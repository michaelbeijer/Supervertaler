### Feature: Dual Text Selection

**What it does:**
- Allows simultaneous text selection in source and target columns
- Both selections remain visible with distinct colors
- Source: Light blue background, dark blue text
- Target: Light green background, dark green text
- Essential for systematic long segment translation

**Reference:** memoQ has this feature, considered essential by professional translators

## üé® Feature Design

### Visual Design

**Source Selection:**
```
Background: #B3E5FC (light blue)
Foreground: #01579B (dark blue)
Tag name: dual_sel_source
```

**Target Selection:**
```
Background: #C8E6C9 (light green)
Foreground: #1B5E20 (dark green)
Tag name: dual_sel_target
```

**Rationale:**
- Different colors prevent confusion
- Blue = source (incoming)
- Green = target (completed)
- High contrast for visibility
- Distinct from other UI colors (status, filters, edit mode)

### Behavior Design

**Activation:**
- Click and drag in source or target Text widget
- Works in read-only mode (not edit mode)
- Row must be selected

**Deactivation:**
- Navigate to different row
- Enter edit mode (F2/double-click)
- Navigate with Ctrl+Up/Down

**Feedback:**
- Status bar shows selected text and character count
- Both selections visible simultaneously
- Clear visual distinction

## üìñ User Experience

### Use Case: Long Legal Segment

**Scenario:** Translating 250-word bilateral investment treaty article

**Workflow:**
1. Select segment in Grid View
2. Source: Select "transfer pricing arrangements"
3. Target: Select "Verrechnungspreisvereinbarungen"
4. ‚úÖ Both highlighted, easy visual verification
5. Source: Select "profit repatriation"
6. Target: Select "Gewinnr√ºckf√ºhrung"
7. ‚úÖ Verify correspondence
8. Continue through entire segment systematically

**Result:** Nothing missed, quality assured, professional workflow

## üìù Final Notes

### What We Built
A professional-grade dual text selection feature that allows translators to select text in both source and target columns simultaneously, with distinct color-coding and seamless integration into the existing Grid View.

### Why It Matters
This is one of the "non-negotiable" features identified in the user's blog post. It's essential for translating long segments systematically and ensuring nothing is missed. Professional CAT tools like memoQ have this feature, and Supervertaler now does too.

### What's Next
User testing and feedback. The feature is implemented and documented, now it needs real-world usage to validate the design and identify any refinements needed.

### Bottom Line
**Supervertaler now has professional-grade dual text selection!** üéâ

This brings the prototype one major step closer to being a complete, professional CAT tool that meets all the non-negotiable requirements for serious translation work.
