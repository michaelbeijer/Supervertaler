# Dual Selection Feature - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Feature**: Dual text selection in Grid View  
**Version**: v0.4.2 (or v0.5.0)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED - READY FOR TESTING**

---

## üéâ What Was Implemented

### Core Feature: Dual Text Selection

You can now **select text in both the source and target columns simultaneously** in Grid View!

This is a professional CAT tool feature (from your blog post) that allows you to:
- ‚úÖ Select corresponding pieces of text in source and target
- ‚úÖ Verify translations piece by piece
- ‚úÖ Ensure nothing is missed in long segments
- ‚úÖ See both selections at the same time with distinct colors

---

## üé® Visual Design

### Selection Colors

**Source Column Selection:**
- Background: Light blue (`#B3E5FC`)
- Text: Dark blue (`#01579B`)
- Clear visual indicator

**Target Column Selection:**
- Background: Light green (`#C8E6C9`)
- Text: Dark green (`#1B5E20`)
- Distinct from source selection

**Why different colors?** So you can see both selections simultaneously without confusion!

---

## üìñ How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. **Open Grid View** (Ctrl+1)
2. **Click on a segment** to select the row
3. **In the source column**: Click and drag to select text
   - Selection appears with light blue background
   - Status bar shows: "Source selection: 'selected text' (X chars)"
4. **In the target column**: Click and drag to select text
   - Selection appears with light green background
   - Status bar shows: "Target selection: 'selected text' (X chars)"
5. **Both selections remain visible** - perfect for comparison!

### Example Workflow

**Scenario**: Translating a long legal segment about transfer pricing

1. Select row containing the long segment
2. In source: Select "transfer pricing arrangements"
3. In target: Select "verrechnungspreisvereinbarungen"
4. **Both are highlighted** - you can visually verify they correspond
5. Move to next piece of text, select again
6. Continue until entire segment is verified

## üîß Technical Details

### What Was Changed

**1. State Variables Added** (Line ~202):
```python
# Dual text selection state (for Grid View)
self.dual_selection_row = None  # Currently active row index
self.dual_selection_source = None  # Source Text widget with selection
self.dual_selection_target = None  # Target Text widget with selection
```

**2. New Methods Created** (Lines ~3461-3584):
- `on_source_text_click(event, row_index)` - Handles source column clicks
- `on_source_selection_made(event, row_index)` - Captures source selections
- `on_target_text_click(event, row_index)` - Handles target column clicks
- `on_target_selection_made(event, row_index)` - Captures target selections
- `clear_dual_selection()` - Clears selection highlights

**3. Event Bindings Modified** (Lines ~2935, ~2970):

**Source text** (was `on_text_widget_click`, now):
```python
source_text.bind('<Button-1>', lambda e, idx=row_index: self.on_source_text_click(e, idx))
source_text.bind('<ButtonRelease-1>', lambda e, idx=row_index: self.on_source_selection_made(e, idx))
```

**Target text** (was `on_target_click`, now):
```python
target_text.bind('<Button-1>', lambda e, idx=row_index: self.on_target_text_click(e, idx))
target_text.bind('<ButtonRelease-1>', lambda e, idx=row_index: self.on_target_selection_made(e, idx))
```

**4. Selection Clearing Logic** (Lines ~2723, ~3099):
- Clears when changing rows
- Clears when entering edit mode
- Prevents interference with editing

## üéØ Behavior Details

### When Dual Selection Activates

‚úÖ When you click and drag in source or target Text widgets  
‚úÖ When widgets are in read-only mode (not edit mode)  
‚úÖ When row is selected

### When Dual Selection Clears

‚úÖ When you navigate to a different row  
‚úÖ When you enter edit mode (F2 or double-click)  
‚úÖ When you manually clear it

### What Doesn't Activate It

‚ùå Single click without dragging  
‚ùå Clicking in edit mode  
‚ùå Clicking outside the row

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Dual Selection
1. Launch the prototype
2. Import a .docx with long segments
3. Go to Grid View
4. Select a row
5. Select text in source ‚Üí verify light blue highlight
6. Select text in target ‚Üí verify light green highlight
7. ‚úÖ **Both should be visible simultaneously**

### Test 2: Selection Clearing
1. Make selections in source and target
2. Click on a different row
3. ‚úÖ **Selections should clear from previous row**

### Test 3: Edit Mode Compatibility
1. Make selections in source and target
2. Double-click target or press F2
3. ‚úÖ **Selections should clear, edit mode should activate**
4. Edit target normally
5. ‚úÖ **Editing should work as before**

### Test 4: Multiple Selections
1. Select text in source
2. Select different text in source again
3. ‚úÖ **Only the latest selection should be highlighted**

### Test 5: Long Segments
1. Find a segment with 100+ words
2. Select portions of source
3. Select corresponding portions of target
4. ‚úÖ **Should work smoothly with no lag**

### Test 6: Status Bar Feedback
1. Make a selection in source
2. Check status bar
3. ‚úÖ **Should show "Source selection: 'text' (X chars)"**
4. Make a selection in target
5. ‚úÖ **Should show "Target selection: 'text' (X chars)"**

## üéì Why This Feature Matters

From your blog post (https://michaelbeijer.co.uk/what_i_look_for_in_a_cat_tool):

> "When translating long segments, I like to move down the source and target sides, selecting corresponding pieces of text to ensure I don't miss anything. A good CAT tool should allow you to make two different selections at the same time. **This is one of those features you don't realize you need until you try it.**"

### Benefits for Translators

1. **Quality Assurance** - Verify each piece was translated
2. **Long Segment Handling** - Break down complex segments visually
3. **Systematic Approach** - Work through segment methodically
4. **Visual Verification** - See correspondence at a glance
5. **Professional Workflow** - Matches memoQ and other professional tools

   - Source: Light blue vs Target: Light green
   - Easy to tell apart?

2. **Is the selection behavior intuitive?**
   - Does it feel natural?
   - Any unexpected behavior?

3. **Does it interfere with existing workflows?**
   - Editing still smooth?
   - Navigation still works?
