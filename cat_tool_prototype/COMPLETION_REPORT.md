## 🎯 What This Solves

### Before (Current Supervertaler)
- Batch translation of entire files
- No segment-by-segment control
- Can't easily edit individual sentences
- No status tracking per segment

### After (With CAT Editor)
- Translate sentence by sentence
- Full control over each segment
- Edit anywhere, anytime
- Track progress per segment
- Professional workflow

---

## 💡 Key Features Explained

## 📊 Workflow Example

### Real-World Patent Translation

**Input:** Patent application (English, 50 pages, 1000 sentences)

**Step 1: Import** (5 seconds)
- Load DOCX
- Auto-segment into 1000 segments
- Ready to translate

**Step 2: Translate** (4-6 hours for human translator)
- Go segment by segment
- Use Ctrl+D for figure references (same in both languages)
- Use Find/Replace for technical terms
- Mark as "Draft" while working
- Mark as "Translated" when confident

**Step 3: Review** (1 hour)
- Export to Bilingual DOCX
- Review source | target side by side
- Make corrections
- Mark as "Approved"

**Step 4: Export** (5 seconds)
- Export to DOCX
- Original formatting preserved
- Ready for filing

**Total:** 5-7 hours vs. several days with manual Word editing

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Segmentation Engine
```python
"This is a test. Dr. Smith works here. The end."
    ↓
[
  "This is a test.",
  "Dr. Smith works here.",
  "The end."
]
```
- Handles abbreviations (Dr., Inc., etc.)
- Respects sentence boundaries
- Preserves paragraph structure

### DOCX Round-Trip
```python
Original DOCX
    ↓ [parse]
Paragraphs with metadata
    ↓ [segment]
Segments with paragraph IDs
    ↓ [translate]
Translated segments
    ↓ [reconstruct]
Translated DOCX (same format)
```

### Project Format
```json
{
  "segments": [
    {"id": 1, "source": "...", "target": "...", "status": "translated"},
    {"id": 2, "source": "...", "target": "...", "status": "draft"}
  ]
}
```
- Human-readable JSON
- Version control friendly
- Easy to backup
