# Changelog Separation - Update Summary

**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Action**: Separated prototype and production changelogs

## What Changed

### Main CHANGELOG.md (Supervertaler root)

**Before**: 
- Had ~400+ lines of detailed prototype entries (v0.3.2, v0.3.1, v0.3.0, v0.2.0, v0.1.1, v0.1.0)
- Mixed experimental and production versions
- Confusing for production users

**After**:
- ✅ Clean, focused on production releases (v2.4.1, v2.4.0, v2.3.0, etc.)
- ✅ Single concise prototype summary at top (25 lines)
- ✅ Clear reference to prototype's own changelog
- ✅ Professional separation of concerns

### Prototype CHANGELOG.md (cat_tool_prototype folder)

**Status**: 
- ✅ Complete detailed history (v0.1.0 through v0.3.2)
- ✅ All technical details preserved
- ✅ ~500 lines of comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Perfect for prototype developers/testers

---

## New Structure

### Main CHANGELOG.md Entry

```markdown
## [Unreleased - CAT Editor Prototype] - 2025-10-01 to 2025-10-02

### Experimental: CAT Editor Prototype Development

A standalone CAT editor prototype is under active development 
in the cat_tool_prototype/ folder.

**Current Status**: Prototype v0.3.2 (Stable, ready for testing)

**Key Features Implemented**:
- ✅ DOCX import/export with full formatting preservation
- ✅ Table support with cell-by-cell translation
- ✅ Style visibility and preservation
- ✅ Inline formatting tags

**Note**: This prototype is experimental and separate from 
the main Supervertaler application.
```
