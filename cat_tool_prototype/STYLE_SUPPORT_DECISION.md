# Style Support - Quick Decision Guide

## 🎯 The Question

**How do we handle Word headings and styles in the CAT Editor?**

## 📊 Current State

### ✅ Already Working
- Style information **IS being captured** (stored in `ParagraphInfo.style`)
- Headings, titles, quotes, lists - all recorded
- Data is there, just not visible or preserved

### ❌ Not Working Yet
- Styles not displayed to translator
- Headings look like regular paragraphs
- Styles lost on export (everything becomes "Normal")

## 🔍 The Problem

### What the translator sees now:
```
#1 | Para | Untranslated | Introduction
#2 | Para | Untranslated | This is the first paragraph
#3 | Para | Untranslated | Background
```

**Problem**: Can't tell that #1 and #3 are headings! They all look the same.

### What happens on export:
```
Original:  [Heading 1] Introduction
Exported:  [Normal]    Introducción  ❌ Style lost!
```

## 💡 Proposed Solution

### Phase A: Display Styles (1-2 hours)
Add style column + visual styling:
```
#1 | Para | H 1    | Untranslated | Introduction          [Bold, Dark Blue]
#2 | Para | Normal | Untranslated | This is the first...  [Regular]
#3 | Para | H 2    | Untranslated | Background            [Bold, Med Blue]
```

### Phase B: Preserve Styles (2-3 hours)
Keep original styles on export:
```
Original:  [Heading 1] Introduction
Exported:  [Heading 1] Introducción  ✅ Style preserved!
```

### Phase C: Advanced Features (5-8 hours)
Filter by style, style-specific settings, analytics

## ⚡ Quick Comparison

| Feature | Now | Phase A | Phase B | Phase C |
|---------|-----|---------|---------|---------|
| See headings in grid | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Visual distinction | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Export preserves style | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Filter by style | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Style analytics | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🎯 Recommendation

### Do Phase A NOW ⭐
**Why:**
- Quick (1-2 hours)
- High impact (immediate feedback)
- We already have the data!
- Makes testing more valuable

**Result:** v0.3.1 with full style visibility

### Do Phase B DURING INTEGRATION
**Why:**
- Fits naturally in Phase 4 (DOCX Export)
- More complex, needs careful testing
- Critical for professional output

**Result:** v2.5.0 with complete style support

### Do Phase C LATER (or never)
**Why:**
- Nice-to-have, not essential
- Better with user feedback
- Time-intensive

**Result:** v2.6.0+ based on demand

## 🚀 Next Action

### Option 1: Implement Phase A Now (Recommended)
```
✅ Add style column
✅ Add visual styling (colors, fonts)
✅ Update display logic
✅ Test with document containing headings
⏱️ Time: 1-2 hours
📦 Result: v0.3.1
```

### Option 2: Do Nothing Yet
```
⏸️ Wait until integration
⚠️ Risk: Less useful testing in Phase 0.2
⏱️ Time: 0 hours now, 3-5 hours later
```

### Option 3: Do A + B Together
```
✅ Complete style support in one go
⚠️ Risk: More complex, longer testing
⏱️ Time: 3-4 hours
📦 Result: v0.4.0
```

## 💭 My Suggestion

**Go with Option 1** - Implement Phase A now:

1. **Quick win** - 1-2 hours of work
2. **Complete the picture** - We have Type, Status, now add Style
3. **Better testing** - Phase 0.2 will be more realistic with style display
4. **No risk** - Backward compatible, easy to implement
5. **Professional feel** - CAT editor feels more complete

Then Phase B naturally fits into the integration plan during Phase 4.
