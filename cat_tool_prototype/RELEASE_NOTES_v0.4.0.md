**Version**: 0.4.0  
**Code Name**: "Document Flow"

---

## üéâ What's New

### Document View - The Game Changer

We're excited to introduce **Document View**, a revolutionary new way to work with translations that shows your document in its natural, flowing form - just like you'd see it in Microsoft Word.

#### Why Document View?

Traditional CAT tools show you a list or grid of segments. But sometimes you need to **see the forest, not just the trees**. Document View lets you:

- **Read naturally** - Text flows as it would in the finished document
- **See context** - Understand how sentences connect and paragraphs flow
- **Review easily** - Perfect for final reviews and quality checks
- **Work with tables** - See table structures as actual tables, not just labeled cells

#### Key Features

‚ú® **Natural Text Flow**
- Paragraphs appear as they would in a Word document
- Proper spacing between sections
- Headings in appropriate sizes and colors
- Text wraps naturally within the viewing area

‚ú® **Table Rendering**
- Tables appear as actual table structures (rows and columns)
- Tables positioned correctly in document (not at the end!)
- Each cell is clickable and editable
- Equal column widths for clean presentation

‚ú® **Smart Display Logic**
- Translated segments show the target text
- Untranslated segments show source (for context)
- Cleared segments show `[empty - click to edit]` placeholder
- Never lose sight of what needs translation

‚ú® **Color-Coded Status**
- üî¥ Red tint - Untranslated
- üü° Yellow tint - Draft
- üü¢ Green tint - Translated  
- üîµ Blue tint - Approved

‚ú® **Interactive Editing**
- Click any segment to edit it
- Editor panel appears below with source and target
- Save updates the document view immediately
- Status colors update in real-time

### View Switching

Seamlessly switch between all view modes while preserving your current position:

| Shortcut | View Mode | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| `Ctrl+1` | **Grid View** | Bulk editing, getting an overview |
| `Ctrl+2` | **Split View** | Focused translation work |
| `Ctrl+3` | **Compact View** | Minimalist workflow (coming soon) |
| `Ctrl+4` | **Document View** | Context, review, final output ‚≠ê NEW |

When you switch views, the current segment stays selected and the view auto-scrolls to show it. No more hunting for where you were!

### UX Improvements

üéØ **Grid View Enhancements**
- `Ctrl+D` now works to copy source to target
- Double-click source column to see full text in popup
- Popup includes "Copy to Clipboard" and "Copy to Target" buttons
- Source text is fully selectable and copyable

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Document Position Tracking

**Problem**: Tables were appearing at the end of documents instead of in their correct position.

**Solution**: We completely rewrote the DOCX import logic to:
- Process document elements in their natural order
- Track each element's position in the source document
- Sort by document position (not segment ID) in Document View

**Result**: Perfect preservation of document structure.

### Text Wrapping

Implemented smart height calculation using `dlineinfo()` to count actual wrapped display lines. Paragraphs now show their full content without vertical clipping.

### Table Rendering

Tables use tkinter's Grid geometry manager for proper row/column layout. Each cell is a clickable Text widget with:
- Word wrapping enabled
- Dynamic height based on content
- Status-based background color
- Hover effects for better UX

## üìä Use Cases

### For Translators

**Before Document View:**
```
Row 45: "The company reported strong earnings."
Row 46: "Revenue increased by 15% year-over-year."
Row 47: "Operating margins improved significantly."
```
*Hard to see the flow and context*

**With Document View:**
```
The company reported strong earnings. Revenue increased 
by 15% year-over-year. Operating margins improved 
significantly.

This growth was driven by...
```
*Natural reading, clear context*

### For Reviewers

- **Quick Scan**: See the entire document at a glance
- **Context Check**: Verify translations make sense in context
- **Flow Review**: Ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs
- **Table Review**: Check that table cells maintain coherence

### For Complex Documents

Perfect for documents with:
- Mixed content (text, tables, headings)
- Long paragraphs that need context
- Multiple sections with different styles
- Tables that need to be reviewed as units

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Using Document View

1. **Import your document** as usual
2. **Click the Document View button** or press `Ctrl+4`
3. **Browse the document** - scroll through to see the layout
4. **Click any segment** to edit it
5. **Edit in the panel below** - source shown above, target field below
6. **Click Save** or press `Ctrl+Enter` to save
7. **Switch views anytime** with `Ctrl+1/2/3/4`

### Best Practices

**Use Grid View when:**
- Starting a new translation
- Doing bulk status changes
- Getting an overview of all segments
- Editing many segments rapidly

**Use Split View when:**
- Focusing on translation quality
- Working through segments sequentially
- Need to see source and target side-by-side

**Use Document View when:**
- Reviewing completed translations
- Checking context and flow
- Working with tables
- Presenting to clients
- Final quality check

## üìà Compatibility

### New Fields

The following fields were added to support Document View:

**Segment class:**
- `document_position` (int) - Position in original document

**ParagraphInfo class:**
- `document_position` (int) - Position in original document

**Backward Compatibility**: Old project files (v0.3.x) will still load. The `document_position` field defaults to 0 if not present. To get proper table positioning, re-import your DOCX file.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Table Position Bug (Critical)

**Issue**: Tables appeared at the end of documents in Document View, not in their correct position.

**Root Cause**: The import process was extracting all regular paragraphs first, then all table cells. This meant tables always got higher IDs than paragraphs, even if they appeared earlier in the document.

**Fix**: 
- Rewrote `import_docx()` to process `document.element.body` in order
- Added `document_position` tracking
- Document View now sorts by `document_position` instead of segment ID

**Impact**: Tables now appear exactly where they should. Document structure is perfectly preserved.
