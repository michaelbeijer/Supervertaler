## 🔐 Security & Configuration Update

**v3.7.1 is a critical security patch and major UX improvement for Supervertaler.**

### 🚨 Important Security Updates

#### What Changed
- **Removed v3.7.0 from all distribution channels** (yanked from PyPI, deleted GitHub release)
- **Removed confidential client data from git history** (364 commits cleaned via git filter-branch)
- **API keys now stored securely** in user-chosen data folder, never in installation
- **Complete reorganization** of user data handling for better security and portability

#### Why
v3.7.0 had an unintended exposure of client project names in git history. This release completely resolves that issue and implements a secure, user-friendly data folder system.

#### What You Should Do
- **Upgrade to v3.7.1** (from v3.7.0 or earlier)
- **Consider API key rotation** (keys were visible in exposed file)
- That's it! First launch will guide you through setup

---

### ✨ What's New in v3.7.1

#### 🔧 User-Configurable Data Folder
- **First Launch**: SetupWizard guides you to choose where your data lives
- **Choose Anywhere**: Documents, Desktop, USB stick, cloud-synced folder - your choice
- **Settings Menu**: New "Change Data Folder" option to move data anytime
- **Benefits**: Data is portable, easy to backup, shareable across devices (if desired)

#### 📁 Improved Folder Structure
```
Your_Chosen_Location/
├── api_keys.txt                    ← Your API credentials (NEVER in git!)
├── Prompt_Library/
│   ├── System_prompts/             ← 19 domain-specific specialist prompts
│   └── Custom_instructions/        ← Your personal translation preferences
├── Translation_Resources/
│   ├── Glossaries/                 ← Your terminology
│   ├── TMs/                        ← Your translation memories
│   ├── Non-translatables/
│   └── Segmentation_rules/
└── Projects/                       ← Your translation projects
```

#### ⚡ Automatic Setup
- `api_keys.txt` created from template automatically
- Existing users: Your old keys migrated automatically
- No manual copying or configuration needed
- Just add your API keys and you're ready
