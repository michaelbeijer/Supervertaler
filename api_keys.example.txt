#
# The file "api_keys.txt" is automatically ignored by Git and 
# will NEVER be uploaded to GitHub.
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# ------------------
# 1. Copy this file to: user data_private/api_keys.txt
# 2. Remove the # symbol before each key you want to use

#
# IMPORTANT:
# ---------
# • Never share your API keys with anyone
# • Never commit api_keys.txt to version control
# • For dev mode: Keep api_keys.txt in user data_private/

#

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# ---------------
# If you see "API Key Missing" errors:
# 1. Check that your file is in: user data_private/api_keys.txt
# 2. Make sure the # is removed from the beginning of the line
# 3. Verify there are no extra spaces around the = sign
# 4. Confirm your key is valid (test at the provider's website)
#
# If keys still don't work:
# 1. Check console output to see which file was loaded
# 2. Look for errors: "Error reading api_keys.txt"
# 3. Restart Supervertaler after editing api_keys.txt
