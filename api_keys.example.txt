# API KEYS CONFIGURATION - SUPERVERTALER v2.5.0
# ============================================================
#
# SECURITY NOTICE:
# ---------------
# This is an EXAMPLE file only. Your actual API keys should be 
# stored in a file named "api_keys.txt" (without .example).
#
# The file "api_keys.txt" is automatically ignored by Git and 
# will NEVER be uploaded to GitHub.
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# ------------------
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to: api_keys.txt
# 2. Remove the # symbol before each key you want to use
# 3. Replace [YOUR_KEY_HERE] with your actual API key
# 4. Save the file
# 5. Restart Supervertaler 
#
# IMPORTANT:
# ---------
# • Never share your API keys with anyone
# • Never commit api_keys.txt to version control
# • Keep api_keys.txt in the same folder as Supervertaler_v2.5.0.py
# • Only api_keys.example.txt should be committed to Git
#

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# ---------------
# If you see "API Key Missing" errors:
# 1. Check that your file is named "api_keys.txt" (not .example)
# 2. Make sure the # is removed from the beginning of the line
# 3. Verify there are no extra spaces around the = sign
# 4. Confirm your key is valid (test at the provider's website)
#
# If keys still don't work:
# 1. Check Translate → API Settings to see what's loaded
# 2. Look in the log panel for specific error messages
# 3. Restart Supervertaler after editing api_keys.txt
