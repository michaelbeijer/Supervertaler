# Linux-Specific Issues

Supervertaler is Linux compatible, but Windows is the primary development platform.

## Spellcheck dictionaries

If spellcheck isn’t working, you may need to install Hunspell dictionaries for your language:

```bash
sudo apt install hunspell-en-us
```

## Stability tips

If you encounter instability:

- Disable spellcheck temporarily
- Disable semantic memory features temporarily
- Use a smaller project to isolate the issue
