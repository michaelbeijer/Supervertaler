# Performance Tips

Supervertaler is designed to stay responsive on large projects, but performance can vary with project size and enabled features.

## Tips

- Enable [Pagination](../editor/pagination.md) for very large projects
- Keep only the needed TMs and glossaries enabled
- If semantic search is enabled, allow indexing to complete

## If it feels slow

Try restarting the app and reopening the project.
