# Navigating Segments

Supervertaler is designed for fast, memoQ-style navigation in the translation grid.

## Moving between segments

- Use the arrow keys to move within a cell.
- When your cursor is at the **top** or **bottom** line of a cell, Up/Down can jump to the previous/next segment.
- Use **Go to Segment** to jump directly to a segment number.

## Pagination

If your project is large, you can enable pagination and move page-by-page.

- See: [Pagination](pagination.md)

## Tips

- Keep one hand on the keyboard for speed: navigate, edit, confirm, repeat.
- If you work in a CAT tool daily, customize shortcuts to match your muscle memory.
