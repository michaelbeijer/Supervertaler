# Editing & Confirming

Translate by editing the **Target** column in the grid.

## Editing

- Click into a Target cell and type your translation.
- Use standard editing shortcuts (undo/redo, copy/paste, find/replace).

## Confirming segments

Confirming matters for many workflows, especially when exporting back to a CAT tool.

Typical workflow:

1. Translate (manual or AI)
2. Review the target text
3. Confirm the segment

{% hint style="info" %}
If you plan to reimport into a CAT tool, avoid merging/splitting content across segments.
{% endhint %}
