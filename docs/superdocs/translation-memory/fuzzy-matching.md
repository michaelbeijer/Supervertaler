# Fuzzy Matching

Fuzzy matching finds similar segments (not just exact duplicates).

## How to use it

- As you navigate, Supervertaler searches your TMs for similar source text.
- Matches are scored by similarity.

## Tips

- Always review fuzzy matches before inserting.
- For formatted text, preserve tags when inserting matches.
