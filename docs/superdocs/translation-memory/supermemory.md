# Supermemory (Semantic Search)

Supermemory adds semantic (meaning-based) search across translation memory content.

## What it’s good for

- Finding relevant past translations even when wording differs
- Working with paraphrased or rewritten source text

## Tips

- Semantic search works best with a well-populated TM.
- Use it via [Superlookup](../superlookup/overview.md).
