# Changelog

Supervertaler keeps a full, detailed changelog in the GitHub repository (this is a very common convention for open source projects):

- https://github.com/michaelbeijer/Supervertaler/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

This Superdocs page exists as a convenient entry point from the online help center.

## Recommended approach

- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` in the repo as the **single source of truth**.
- Link to it from Superdocs (here) and from the website.

That gives you:
- A canonical changelog that’s versioned with code changes
- A stable URL for GitHub releases, issues, and automation
- A friendly “Documentation” navigation entry for end users
