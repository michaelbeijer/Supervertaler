# Creating Prompts

Prompts control how the AI translates (tone, domain, rules, formatting).

## What makes a good translation prompt

- Target audience and tone (formal/informal)
- Domain constraints (legal, medical, technical)
- Rules for numbers, punctuation, terminology
- Instructions to preserve tags and placeholders

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your text contains formatting or CAT tool tags, instruct the model to preserve them exactly.
{% endhint %}
