# Single Segment Translation

Use single-segment translation when you want maximum control: translate one segment, review, then confirm.

## Typical workflow

1. Select a segment
2. Run **Translate current segment**
3. Review the result
4. Edit if needed
5. Confirm the segment

## Tips

- Single-segment mode is great for tricky sentences and high-stakes text.
- Use [Superlookup](../superlookup/overview.md) for research before confirming.
