## 🎯 User Journey

### Windows User (70% of users):
1. Sees download link at top of README
2. Downloads ZIP from GitHub Releases
3. Extracts and runs - **no Python needed**
4. **Time to first run**: 2 minutes

### macOS User (25% of users):
1. Sees clear macOS section in README
2. Follows 4-step installation or clicks detailed guide
3. Installs Python + dependencies (if needed)
4. Runs script
5. **Time to first run**: 5-10 minutes
6. **Optional**: Can vote for native `.app` or build their own

### Linux User (5% of users):
1. Sees clear Linux section in README
2. Follows distribution-specific commands
3. Installs Python + tkinter + dependencies
4. Runs script
5. **Time to first run**: 5-10 minutes
6. **Optional**: Can vote for AppImage or build their own

## 💡 Key Decisions

### Why Python Script for Mac/Linux (Now)?

1. **Development efficiency**: 1 codebase vs 3 platform-specific builds
2. **Faster updates**: No rebuild delays for bug fixes
3. **User base**: 70% Windows - majority covered
4. **Technical users**: Mac/Linux users typically comfortable with Python
5. **Testing burden**: Don't need Mac/Linux machines for every release
6. **Build time**: Windows build takes 3-5 minutes × 3 platforms = time-consuming

### When to Create Native Builds?

**Triggers**:
- ✅ 10+ votes on GitHub issue
- ✅ User base grows to 100+ active users
- ✅ Mac/Linux users report installation difficulties
- ✅ Professional translators request it (they may pay)

**Requirements**:
- macOS machine (or GitHub Actions)
- Linux VM (or GitHub Actions)
- Apple Developer account ($99/year for code signing - optional)
- Time for building + testing on each platform (~2 hours per release)

## 🚀 What Happens Next?

### Immediate (Today):
- ✅ README updated with download instructions
- ✅ Comprehensive Mac/Linux guides created
- ✅ GitHub issue template ready for votes
- ✅ Distribution strategy documented

### Short-term (Next Week):
- [ ] Publish v2.4.1 to GitHub Releases
- [ ] Monitor download statistics
- [ ] Track platform request issue votes
- [ ] Respond to installation questions

### Medium-term (1-3 Months):
- [ ] If 10+ votes: Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds
- [ ] If demand exists: Create macOS `.app`
- [ ] If demand exists: Create Linux AppImage
- [ ] Consider Homebrew formula (macOS): `brew install supervertaler`
- [ ] Consider Snap/Flatpak (Linux)

### Long-term (6+ Months):
- [ ] If user base >500: Professional installers (Inno Setup for Windows, DMG for macOS, DEB/RPM for Linux)
- [ ] If revenue stream exists: Code signing certificates ($99-500/year)
- [ ] If enterprise users: Web-based version consideration

## 📈 Success Metrics

**Track these to gauge platform demand**:

1. **GitHub Releases**:
   - Download count (Windows vs source code)
   - Download trend over time

2. **GitHub Issues**:
   - Platform request votes
   - Mac/Linux installation issues
   - Feature requests from Mac/Linux users

3. **Community Engagement**:
   - Stars/forks growth
   - Mac/Linux contributor involvement
   - Translation from Mac/Linux users

4. **Support Burden**:
   - Installation help requests
   - Platform-specific bugs
   - User testimonials

**Decision Point**: If Mac/Linux downloads exceed 30% of Windows downloads, prioritize native builds.
