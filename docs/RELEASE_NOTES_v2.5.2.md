## 🎉 What's New

### ⚡ Grid Pagination System - 10x Performance Boost!

**The Problem**: Loading 355 segments in grid view took 6-7 seconds and could freeze the UI.

**The Solution**: Smart pagination system that loads only what you need.

#### Features:
- **Page size options**: 25, 50, 100, 200, or "All" segments per page
- **Navigation controls**:
  - ⏮ First Page
  - ◀ Previous Page
  - Page number input (jump to any page)
  - Next Page ▶
  - Last Page ⏭
- **Real-time status**: "Segments 1-50 of 355"
- **Dynamic page selector**: Choose how many segments to view

#### Benefits:
- ✅ **10x faster**: Grid view loads in ~0.5 seconds instead of 6-7 seconds
- ✅ **No more freezing**: Eliminates UI freeze when switching views
- ✅ **Professional behavior**: Works like memoQ, Trados, and other CAT tools
- ✅ **Works with filters**: Filtered segments are also paginated

### 🧠 Smart Paragraph Detection

**The Problem**: Imported memoQ/CafeTran documents showed every segment as its own paragraph, breaking document flow.

**The Solution**: Intelligent paragraph grouping using smart heuristics.

#### How it works:
1. **Detects headings**: Short, all-caps text without ending punctuation = new paragraph
2. **Groups related sentences**: Sentences under the same heading flow together
3. **Identifies natural breaks**: Previous heading + new heading = paragraph break

#### Benefits:
- ✅ **Proper document structure**: Headings separated from body text
- ✅ **Natural text flow**: Sentences within paragraphs flow with spaces
- ✅ **Maintains hierarchy**: Document structure preserved
- ✅ **Applies automatically**: Works on memoQ and CafeTran imports

#### Example:
**Before** (v2.5.1):
```
HEADING ONE

First sentence.

Second sentence.

Third sentence.
```

**After** (v2.5.2):
```
HEADING ONE

First sentence. Second sentence. Third sentence.
```

### 🛡️ Enhanced Loading Protection

**The Problem**: Clicking in the grid while loading could cause window resize/freeze issues.

**The Solution**: Full-screen interaction blocker during loading.

#### Features:
- **Visual overlay**: "Loading page... Please wait." message
- **Complete event blocking**: Prevents all mouse/keyboard input during load
- **Automatic removal**: Overlay disappears when loading completes

#### Benefits:
- ✅ **Prevents crashes**: No more accidental clicks during loading
- ✅ **Clear feedback**: Users know the system is working
- ✅ **Guaranteed safety**: Uses try/finally to ensure cleanup
