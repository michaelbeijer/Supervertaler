# Context-Aware Translation Implementation (v2.5.0)

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Feature**: Full Document Context for AI Translation  
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Ready for Testing

---

## Overview

Implemented **full document context** support for AI-powered translations, following the proven approach from v2.4.0. This feature provides the AI model with complete document awareness, resulting in significantly better translation quality for technical and patent documents.

## Why Full Document Context Matters

### For Patent Documents
- **Cross-references**: Patents frequently reference earlier sections ("as described in paragraph [0023]")
- **Terminology consistency**: Technical terms must be translated identically throughout
- **Complex dependencies**: Later sections build on concepts from earlier sections
- **Figure references**: Descriptions reference drawings and previous explanations
- **Legal precision**: Consistency is critical for legal validity

### Translation Quality Improvements
- ✅ **Better pronoun resolution** - AI knows what "it", "this", or "said device" refers to
- ✅ **Consistent terminology** - AI maintains same translation for recurring technical terms
- ✅ **Contextual understanding** - AI grasps the overall subject matter and purpose
- ✅ **Tone preservation** - AI maintains consistent style across the entire document
- ✅ **Accurate references** - AI correctly translates references to earlier content

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Method: `get_full_document_context()`

**Location**: Lines ~6658-6681

```python
def get_full_document_context(self, include_translations=False):
    """
    Build full document context string with all segments.
    This provides the AI with complete document understanding.
    
    Args:
        include_translations: If True, include existing translations alongside source text
    
    Returns:
        str: Formatted document context with numbered segments
    """
```

**Features**:
- Assembles all source segments into a single numbered list
- Optional inclusion of existing translations for consistency
- Segment IDs preserved for traceability
- Clean formatting for AI consumption

**Example Output**:
```
1. A method for processing data comprising:
2. receiving input from a sensor;
3. analyzing the input using a processor;
4. generating an output signal based on the analysis.
```

### 2. Updated Translation Method

**Location**: Lines ~6716-6820

The `translate_current_segment()` method now builds a structured prompt with:

1. **System Prompt** - Translation instructions with language variables replaced
2. **Custom Instructions** - Project-specific guidance
3. **Full Document Context** - All segments for reference (if enabled)
4. **Segment to Translate** - The specific segment being worked on
5. **Output Instructions** - Clear formatting guidance

**Prompt Structure**:
```
[System Prompt - How to translate]

**SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS PROJECT:**
[Custom instructions from Custom Instructions tab]

**FULL DOCUMENT CONTEXT FOR REFERENCE:**
(Use this context to understand terminology, references, and maintain consistency)

1. First segment of document...
2. Second segment of document...
3. Third segment of document...
[... all segments ...]

**SEGMENT TO TRANSLATE:**
Segment 42: [Source text of current segment]

**YOUR TRANSLATION (provide ONLY the translated text, no numbering or labels):**
```

### 3. Batch Translation with Context

**Location**: Lines ~6858-7000

Implemented comprehensive batch translation:
- ✅ Progress bar dialog with real-time updates
- ✅ TM lookup before AI call (saves time and cost)
- ✅ Full document context for each segment
- ✅ Cancellation support
- ✅ Error handling with detailed logging
- ✅ Summary statistics on completion
- ✅ Include existing translations in context (helps maintain consistency as batch progresses)

**Features**:
- Processes untranslated segments sequentially
- Shows current segment being translated
- Handles API errors gracefully
- Updates TM after each successful translation
- Refreshes grid automatically

### 4. UI Enhancements

#### Settings Tab
**Location**: Lines ~1942-1947

- Updated checkbox label to "Use full document context (recommended for technical/patent documents)"
- Added helpful info label explaining the benefit
- Default: **Enabled** (best for patents and technical docs)

#### Custom Instructions Tab
**Location**: Lines ~1574-1590

Added **Document Context Status** panel showing:
- Context enabled/disabled status (color-coded)
- Number of segments in document
- Total character count of context
- Helpful explanation of what context provides

**Display Updates**:
- Refreshes automatically when segments change
- Shows "Enabled ✓" in blue or "Disabled ✗" in red
- Character count formatted with commas for readability

### 5. API Method Updates

**Claude API** - Increased max_tokens from 4096 to 8192
- Handles longer translations that may result from better context understanding
- Ensures AI can provide complete translations without truncation

## How It Works: Translation Flow

### Single Segment Translation

1. **User selects segment** and presses Ctrl+T or uses menu
2. **TM check** - Exact and fuzzy matches checked first
3. **Context enabled?** - Check user preference
4. **Build context** - Get all document segments (if enabled)
5. **Assemble prompt**:
   - System prompt (How to translate)
   - Custom instructions (What to focus on)
   - Full document context (All segments for reference)
   - Specific segment to translate
6. **API call** - Send to OpenAI/Claude/Gemini
7. **Update segment** - Store translation and mark as translated
8. **Add to TM** - Store for future use
9. **Refresh UI** - Show new translation

### Batch Translation

1. **User selects "Translate All Untranslated"**
2. **Confirmation dialog** - Shows count, provider, context status
3. **Progress dialog appears** - Real-time updates
4. **For each untranslated segment**:
   - Check TM first (skip AI if match found)
   - Build prompt with full context (including newly translated segments)
   - Call AI API
   - Update segment and TM
   - Update progress bar
   - Check for cancel request
5. **Completion** - Show summary statistics
6. **UI refresh** - Display all new translations

## User Configuration

### Enabling/Disabling Context

**Location**: Settings Tab (10th tab in Translation Workspace)

**To Enable**:
1. Open Settings tab
2. Check "Use full document context"
3. Translations will include full document reference

**To Disable** (not recommended for patents):
1. Uncheck the option
2. Translations will use only system prompt + custom instructions
3. Faster but lower quality for technical content

**Recommendation**: Keep **enabled** for:
- Patent documents
- Technical manuals
- Legal documents
- Long-form content with cross-references
- Documents requiring high terminology consistency

Disable only for:
- Very short documents (< 10 segments)
- Unrelated segments (like UI strings)
- Testing/experimentation

## Performance Considerations

### Token Usage
- Full document context increases prompt size significantly
- **Example**: 50-segment patent = ~10,000-20,000 characters of context
- **Costs**: Higher per-translation cost but MUCH better quality
- **Optimization**: Context is built once per translation, not per API call

### API Limits
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 supports 128K tokens (plenty for most patents)
- **Claude**: Supports 200K tokens (excellent for large documents)
- **Gemini**: Supports 1M tokens (exceptional for very large patents)

**Typical Patent**:
- 100 segments × 200 chars avg = 20,000 chars context
- Plus system prompt + custom instructions = ~25,000 chars
- Well within all providers' limits

### Speed vs. Quality Trade-off
- **With Context**: Slower (larger prompts) but significantly better quality
- **Without Context**: Faster but potentially inconsistent terminology
- **Recommendation**: Context is worth the extra time for patents

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Selective Context** - Include only relevant paragraphs (semantic search)
2. **Context Caching** - Providers like Claude support prompt caching
3. **Smart Context Window** - Adaptive context size based on document structure
4. **Context Preview** - Show actual context that will be sent to AI
5. **Context Statistics** - Track token usage per translation

### V2.6.0 Ideas
- Visual context preview in dedicated tab
- Token count estimation before translation
- Context optimization (remove redundant segments)
- Multi-level context (paragraph → section → document)
