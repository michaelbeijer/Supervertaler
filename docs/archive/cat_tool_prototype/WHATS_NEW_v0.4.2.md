# What's New in v0.4.2

**Release Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Major Feature**: Dual Text Selection 🎉

---

## 🎉 Headline Feature: Dual Text Selection

You can now **select text in both source and target columns at the same time** in Grid View!

### Why This Matters

From the blog post "What I look for in a CAT tool":

> "When translating long segments, I like to move down the source and target sides, selecting corresponding pieces of text to ensure I don't miss anything. A good CAT tool should allow you to make two different selections at the same time. **This is one of those features you don't realize you need until you try it.**"

This is a **non-negotiable feature** for professional CAT tools, and Supervertaler now has it!

## 🎨 How It Works

### Visual Design

**Source Selection**: Light blue background with dark blue text  
**Target Selection**: Light green background with dark green text

Both selections are visible simultaneously with clearly distinct colors!

### Basic Usage

1. **Select a segment** in Grid View
2. **Click and drag** in the source column to select text
3. **Click and drag** in the target column to select text
4. **Both selections remain visible** - perfect for comparison!

### Example Workflow

**Translating a long legal segment:**

```
Source: "The bilateral investment treaty includes provisions regarding 
         transfer pricing arrangements, profit repatriation, and dispute
         resolution mechanisms..."

Target: "Das bilaterale Investitionsabkommen enthält Bestimmungen über
         Verrechnungspreisvereinbarungen, Gewinnrückführung und 
         Streitbeilegungsmechanismen..."
```

**Using dual selection:**
1. Select "transfer pricing arrangements" in source (blue highlight)
2. Select "Verrechnungspreisvereinbarungen" in target (green highlight)
3. ✅ Visual verification - both highlighted, easy to see correspondence
4. Move to next phrase, repeat
5. Work through entire segment systematically
