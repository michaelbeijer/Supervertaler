## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Replaced Incomplete Style Guides Stub in Prompt Manager
- **Before:** Prompt Manager had a bare-bones TreeView list of style guides
- **After:** Full 3-panel implementation integrated into Prompt Manager:
  - **Left Panel:** Language list with auto-load on selection
  - **Center Panel:** Formatted/Raw markdown editor with toggle switch
  - **Right Panel:** AI Assistant chat interface for intelligent editing

### 2. ✅ Removed Style Guides Tab from Assistant Panel
- Deleted the `create_style_guides_tab()` method (128 lines)
- Removed Style Guides from the `create_tabbed_assistance()` tab definitions
- Removed associated UI registry entries
- **Result:** Cleaner Assistant panel without the orphaned "Style Guides" tab

### 3. ✅ Preserved All Functionality
- All helper methods (`_on_style_guide_select`, `_on_style_guide_save`, etc.) remain intact
- Formatted markdown viewing fully functional
- Edit toggle (Raw vs. Formatted) working perfectly
- AI Assistant chat interface preserved
- Import/Export capabilities intact
