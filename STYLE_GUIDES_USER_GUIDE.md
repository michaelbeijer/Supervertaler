   ```

   ```
   - Currency: Use â‚¬ (EUR) not â‚¬ (Euro)
     Example: â‚¬100,00 not â‚¬100.00
   ```

3. **Cross-Reference**: Link related rules
   ```
   - See "Punctuation" section for dash usage
   ```

4. **Version Control**: Include dates for updates
   ```
   - Last updated: 2024-01-15
   - Previous version: 2023-12-01
   ```
