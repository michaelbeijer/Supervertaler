Multi-Selection Test Script

Quick verification that multi-selection system works correctly.

Test Scenarios:
1. Single click - selects row, clears others
2. Ctrl+Click - toggles selection
3. Shift+Click - selects range
4. Ctrl+A - selects all
5. Pagination - selection persists across pages
6. Visual highlighting - blue #CCE5FF applied/removed correctly
