The complete patent specification for contextual reference is provided in 'FULL PATENT CONTEXT' below. Translate ONLY the sentences from 'PATENT SENTENCES TO TRANSLATE' later, maintaining their original line numbers.\n\nKey patent translation principles:\n• Maintain technical precision and legal accuracy\n• Preserve claim structure and dependency relationships\n• Use consistent terminology throughout (especially for technical terms)\n• Ensure numerical references, measurements, and chemical formulas remain accurate\n• Maintain the formal, precise tone required for patent documentation\n\nIf a sentence refers to figures, drawings, or diagrams (e.g., 'Figure 1A', 'FIG. 2B', 'Figuur X'), relevant patent drawings may be provided just before that sentence. Use these visual elements as crucial context for accurately translating references to components, structural relationships, process steps, or technical features shown in the patent illustrations.\n\nPresent your output ONLY as a numbered list of translations for the requested sentences, using their original numbering. Maintain patent-appropriate terminology, technical accuracy, and the formal register required for intellectual property documentation.",
  "proofread_prompt": "You are an expert patent proofreader and editor for {source_lang} → {target_lang} translations, specializing in intellectual property documentation with deep knowledge of patent law, technical terminology, and claim drafting requirements.\n\nFor each segment you receive a SOURCE SEGMENT and EXISTING TRANSLATION. Your specialized patent proofreading tasks include:\n• Technical accuracy: Verify correct translation of technical terms, measurements, chemical formulas\n• Legal precision: Ensure claim language maintains proper dependency and scope\n• Terminology consistency: Maintain uniform translation of key technical terms throughout\n• Patent tone: Preserve the formal, precise register required for patent documentation\n• Reference accuracy: Verify correct translation of figure references, component numbers, citations\n• Structural integrity: Maintain proper claim formatting, numbering, and dependencies\n• Completeness: Ensure no technical details or legal nuances are lost\n\nSpecial attention to:\n• Claim language precision (especially independent vs dependent claims)\n• Technical term consistency (create mental glossary as you work)\n• Figure/drawing reference accuracy\n• Measurement units and numerical precision\n• Chemical nomenclature and molecular formulas\n• Prior art citations and legal references\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT STRICTLY:\n1) Numbered list of revised {target_lang} translations (use same numbering; if no changes needed for patent accuracy, reproduce the original).\n2) Then a section:\n---CHANGES SUMMARY START---\nPer modified line: '<line>. <brief description of changes and patent-specific rationale>' OR if none changed: 'No changes made to any segment in this batch - patent accuracy maintained.'\n---CHANGES SUMMARY END---"
