## üîê Security & Configuration Update

**v3.7.1 is a critical security patch and major UX improvement for Supervertaler.**

### üö® Important Security Updates

#### What Changed
- **Removed v3.7.0 from all distribution channels** (yanked from PyPI, deleted GitHub release)
- **Removed confidential client data from git history** (364 commits cleaned via git filter-branch)
- **API keys now stored securely** in user-chosen data folder, never in installation
- **Complete reorganization** of user data handling for better security and portability

#### Why
v3.7.0 had an unintended exposure of client project names in git history. This release completely resolves that issue and implements a secure, user-friendly data folder system.

#### What You Should Do
- **Upgrade to v3.7.1** (from v3.7.0 or earlier)
- **Consider API key rotation** (keys were visible in exposed file)
- That's it! First launch will guide you through setup

---

### ‚ú® What's New in v3.7.1

#### üîß User-Configurable Data Folder
- **First Launch**: SetupWizard guides you to choose where your data lives
- **Choose Anywhere**: Documents, Desktop, USB stick, cloud-synced folder - your choice
- **Settings Menu**: New "Change Data Folder" option to move data anytime
- **Benefits**: Data is portable, easy to backup, shareable across devices (if desired)

#### üìÅ Improved Folder Structure
