## Test Breakdown

### 1️⃣ Batch Operations Tests (6/6 Pass) ✅
**File:** `test_batch_operations.py`

| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Add to all 5 languages | ✅ PASS | Text successfully added to Dutch, English, Spanish, German, French |
| Add to specific language | ✅ PASS | Text added only to Dutch, not to other languages |
| Multiple additions (stress test) | ✅ PASS | 5 consecutive additions all succeeded |
| File persistence | ✅ PASS | Reloaded library confirms content persisted correctly |
| Invalid language handling | ✅ PASS | Correctly rejects invalid language "Klingon" |
| Empty text handling | ✅ PASS | Handles empty input gracefully |

### 2️⃣ Command Parsing Tests (17/17 Pass) ✅
**File:** `test_command_parsing.py`

**Commands Tested:**
- ✅ `"add to all: - Rule"` (lowercase, capitalized, uppercase variations)
- ✅ `"add to Dutch: - Rule"` (all 5 languages individually)
- ✅ `"show"`, `"list"`, `"list languages"` (all aliases)
- ✅ Error cases with empty text
- ✅ Error cases with invalid languages
- ✅ General queries routing to AI (not batch commands)

**All 17 variations passed with correct behavior**

### 3️⃣ AI Integration Tests (4/4 Pass) ✅
**File:** `test_ai_integration.py`

| Component | Result | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| API Key Loading | ✅ PASS | OpenAI key successfully loaded |
| PromptAssistant Methods | ✅ PASS | All required methods present |
| StyleGuideLibrary | ✅ PASS | All backend methods available |
| Offline Mode | ✅ PASS | Provides helpful guidance without LLM |

## What's Now Working

### ✅ Batch Operations
```
User types: "add to all: - New formatting rule"
System: Adds to all 5 languages instantly, displays confirmation
File: Changes saved automatically
```

### ✅ Specific Language Targeting
```
User types: "add to German: - German quotation marks"
System: Adds to German only, other languages unchanged
Verification: Only German has the new rule
```

### ✅ Intelligent Command Routing
```
User types: "add to all: - Rule" 
→ Recognized as batch command, executed locally

User types: "Suggest formatting rules"
→ Recognized as general query, routed to AI
```

### ✅ Offline Mode
```
If no OpenAI API key configured:
- Batch commands still work perfectly
- General queries show helpful command suggestions
- No errors or crashes
```

### ✅ Error Handling
```
Invalid language → "Language not found. Available: ..."
Empty text → "Please provide text after 'add to all:'"
→ All errors are helpful and guide users to correct usage
```
