# Dashboard Fixes - Supervertaler v2.5.0

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Issues**: Visibility, scrolling, and layout problems

---

## 🐛 Issues Identified

### **Issue 1: Title Overlap**
- **Problem**: Subtitle "Professional CAT tool..." was overlapping with main title
- **Cause**: Both title and subtitle using same `current_row` value
- **Visible**: Title text was unreadable at top of dashboard

### **Issue 2: CAT Editor Section Not Visible**
- **Problem**: CAT Editor section mentioned in workflow but cut off at bottom
- **Cause**: No scrolling in left panel, content exceeded screen height
- **Impact**: Users couldn't access CAT Editor configuration

### **Issue 3: Expandable Sections Go Off-Screen**
- **Problem**: When expanding "Prompt Library" or "Project Library", content extends beyond visible area
- **Cause**: No scroll support in left panel
- **Impact**: Expanded content invisible/inaccessible

### **Issue 4: No Scroll Support**
- **Problem**: Dashboard left panel was fixed height with no scrolling
- **Cause**: Direct grid layout on `left_frame` without canvas wrapper
- **Impact**: Any content below ~900px height was inaccessible

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### **Fix 1: Scrollable Left Panel**

**Before**:
```python
left_frame = tk.Frame(main_paned, bg="white", relief=tk.SUNKEN, bd=2)
main_paned.add(left_frame, minsize=500, width=600)
```

**After**:
```python
# Create container with canvas and scrollbar
left_container = tk.Frame(main_paned, bg="white", relief=tk.SUNKEN, bd=2)
main_paned.add(left_container, minsize=500, width=600)

# Canvas for scrolling
left_canvas = tk.Canvas(left_container, bg="white", highlightthickness=0)
left_scrollbar = tk.Scrollbar(left_container, orient="vertical", command=left_canvas.yview)
left_frame = tk.Frame(left_canvas, bg="white")

# Configure scroll region
left_frame.bind(
    "<Configure>",
    lambda e: left_canvas.configure(scrollregion=left_canvas.bbox("all"))
)

left_canvas.create_window((0, 0), window=left_frame, anchor="nw")
left_canvas.configure(yscrollcommand=left_scrollbar.set)

# Pack canvas and scrollbar
left_canvas.pack(side="left", fill="both", expand=True)
left_scrollbar.pack(side="right", fill="y")

# Mousewheel scrolling
def _on_mousewheel(event):
    left_canvas.yview_scroll(int(-1*(event.delta/120)), "units")
left_canvas.bind_all("<MouseWheel>", _on_mousewheel)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Entire dashboard is now scrollable
- ✅ All sections remain visible regardless of expansion
- ✅ Mousewheel scrolling works
- ✅ Scrollbar appears automatically when needed

### **Fix 2: Title/Subtitle Separation**

**Before**:
```python
title_label.grid(row=current_row, column=0, columnspan=3, padx=5, pady=(10,15), sticky="ew")
subtitle_label.grid(row=current_row, column=0, columnspan=3, padx=5, pady=(0,10), sticky="ew")
current_row += 1  # Only incremented ONCE
```

**After**:
```python
title_label.grid(row=current_row, column=0, columnspan=3, padx=5, pady=(10,2), sticky="ew")
current_row += 1  # Increment AFTER title

subtitle_label.grid(row=current_row, column=0, columnspan=3, padx=5, pady=(0,10), sticky="ew")
current_row += 1  # Increment AFTER subtitle
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Title and subtitle on separate rows
- ✅ No text overlap
- ✅ Clean visual hierarchy
- ✅ Both fully readable

---

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### **Before (Problems)**:
- ❌ Title unreadable due to overlap
- ❌ CAT Editor section invisible (off-screen)
- ❌ Expanding Prompt Library → content disappears off bottom
- ❌ Expanding Project Library → content disappears off bottom
- ❌ No way to access content below fold
- ❌ Dashboard felt cramped and broken

### **After (Solutions)**:
- ✅ Title and subtitle clearly visible and separated
- ✅ All sections accessible via scrolling
- ✅ Expanding any section works perfectly
- ✅ Mousewheel scrolling throughout dashboard
- ✅ Scrollbar appears when needed
- ✅ Content can grow dynamically without layout issues
- ✅ Professional, polished appearance

## 📐 Technical Details

### **Scroll Region Configuration**:
The `<Configure>` event binding automatically updates the scroll region whenever the content size changes. This means:
- Expanding "Prompt Library" → scroll region grows → content accessible
- Expanding "Project Library" → scroll region grows → content accessible
- Expanding "CAT Editor" → scroll region grows → content accessible
- Collapsing sections → scroll region shrinks

### **Mousewheel Scrolling**:
Bound to entire canvas using `bind_all()`:
- Works anywhere in the left panel
- Smooth scrolling with standard mousewheel
- Windows-compatible (`event.delta/120`)

### **Canvas vs. Frame Structure**:
```
main_paned
├─ left_container (Frame)
│  ├─ left_canvas (Canvas) ← Scrollable
│  │  └─ left_frame (Frame) ← Content grid goes here
│  └─ left_scrollbar (Scrollbar)
├─ right_paned (PanedWindow)
   ├─ info_frame
   └─ log_frame
```
