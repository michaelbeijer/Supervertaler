# Next Steps: Parallel Folder Structure Implementation

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Code Complete** - Both programs refactored  
✅ **Git-Safe Migration Script** - Ready to run  
✅ **Testing Checklist** - Comprehensive test plan created  
⏳ **Migration** - Not yet run  
⏳ **Testing** - Not yet started

## 🚀 What to Do Next

### **Step 1: Run the Migration Script** (5 minutes)

This will safely move your private data from the old structure to the new one.

```powershell
cd .dev
.\migrate_to_parallel_structure.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- ✓ Detects existing `*_private/` folders
- ✓ Shows you exactly what will be migrated
- ✓ Asks for confirmation before proceeding
- ✓ Creates `user data_private/` structure
- ✓ MOVES (not copies) all your private files
- ✓ Removes old empty folders
- ✓ Updates git staging appropriately

**Safe because:**
- Your data is moved, not copied (no duplicates)
- Git is aware of the changes (no sync issues)
- `.gitignore` already updated (private data stays private)
- Old folders only removed if empty
- You can always restore from git if needed

---

### **Step 2: Quick Smoke Test** (5 minutes)

Just make sure both programs launch without errors:

**CLASSIC version:**
```powershell
python Supervertaler_v2.4.3-CLASSIC.py
```

**CAT version:**
```powershell
python Supervertaler_v3.1.0-beta_CAT.py
```

**Look for:**
- ✓ Red "🔒 DEV MODE" banner at the top
- ✓ Programs launch without errors
- ✓ Can see your private prompts/projects

---

### **Step 3: Comprehensive Testing** (30 minutes)

Follow the detailed testing checklist:

```powershell
# Open the checklist
code .dev\TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
```

Test both programs in:
- **User mode** (rename `.supervertaler.local` temporarily)
- **Dev mode** (with `.supervertaler.local` present)

**Critical tests:**
- Save/load prompts in both modes
- Save/load projects in both modes
- Verify file locations are correct
- Confirm git ignores private data

---

### **Step 4: Commit Changes** (5 minutes)

Once testing is complete and everything works:

```powershell
# Check what git sees
git status

# Stage structural changes (not private data)
git add .gitignore
git add Supervertaler_v2.4.3-CLASSIC.py
git add Supervertaler_v3.1.0-beta_CAT.py
git add .dev/

# Commit
git commit -m "Refactor: Parallel folder structure for private data

- Changed from suffix-based (*_private) to parallel structure
- user data/ for public, user data_private/ for dev mode
- Simplified .gitignore (7 lines → 1 line)
- Removed all private UI elements (checkboxes, [Private] labels)
- Added dev mode status banners
- Auto-routing based on .supervertaler.local flag
- All folders auto-route: System_prompts, Custom_instructions, Projects"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

**Verify:**
- Private data NOT in commit (check with `git diff --cached`)
- Only code and structure changes committed

---

### **Step 5: Update Documentation** (15 minutes - Optional)

Update these files if needed:

1. **`.dev/PRIVATE_FEATURES_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**
   - Document the parallel structure approach
   - Explain how auto-routing works
   - Add examples

2. **`README.md`** (if you have developer setup section)
   - Mention `.supervertaler.local` file
   - Explain dev mode vs user mode

3. **`CHANGELOG.md`**
   - Add entry for this major refactor

---

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Before considering this complete, verify:

- [ ] Migration script ran successfully
- [ ] All private files in new locations
- [ ] Both programs work in user mode
- [ ] Both programs work in dev mode
- [ ] Git doesn't track private data
- [ ] Old `*_private/` folders removed
- [ ] New `user data_private/` folder works
- [ ] Code committed and pushed

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Git Safety**

The migration script is git-aware:
- Old `*_private/` folders were already gitignored
- New `user data_private/` is also gitignored
- Moving files doesn't change git tracking
- Safe to commit after migration

### **Rollback Plan**

If something goes wrong:

```powershell
# Restore to pre-migration state
git restore .
git clean -fd

# Or restore specific files
git restore Supervertaler_v2.4.3-CLASSIC.py
git restore Supervertaler_v3.1.0-beta_CAT.py
```

Your private data is safe because:
- It's already gitignored
- Git doesn't track it
- You can manually copy it back if needed

### **Testing Tips**

1. **Use a test project first**
   - Create a dummy prompt/project
   - Test save/load in both modes
   - Verify file locations

2. **Check file system**
   - Open File Explorer
   - Navigate to `user data_private/`
   - Verify your files are there

3. **Test mode switching**
   - Rename `.supervertaler.local`
   - Launch app (should be user mode)
   - Rename back
   - Launch app (should be dev mode)
