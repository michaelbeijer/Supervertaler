# Private Features Implementation - October 11, 2025

## Overview

Implemented a clean solution to enable private features for developers while keeping the UI simple and clean for end users.

## How It Works

### Feature Flag: `.supervertaler.local`

- **Presence of file** = Private features enabled (developer mode)
- **Absence of file** = Private features disabled (user mode)
- File is gitignored, so it never syncs to GitHub

### For Developers (You)

1. Keep `.supervertaler.local` file in your repo root âœ… (Already created)
2. Private checkboxes appear in UI with ðŸ”’ icon
3. Can save to private folders:
   - `user data/System_prompts_private/`
   - `user data/Custom_instructions_private/`
   - `user data/Projects_private/`
4. Console shows: `[DEV MODE] Private features enabled`

### For Users

1. Clone repo â†’ No `.supervertaler.local` file exists
2. No private checkboxes in UI
3. No [Private] labels in lists
4. Clean, simple experience
5. Private folders exist but are never scanned/used

## Changes Made

### Both Programs

1. Added feature flag after APP_VERSION constant:
   ```python
   ENABLE_PRIVATE_FEATURES = os.path.exists(
       os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), ".supervertaler.local")
   )
   ```

2. Wrapped UI elements in conditionals:
   - System prompts private checkbox
   - Projects private checkbox
   - Private folder scanning

### Files Modified

1. **`.gitignore`**
   - Added `.supervertaler.local` to ignore list

2. **`Supervertaler_v2.4.3-CLASSIC.py`**
   - Added ENABLE_PRIVATE_FEATURES flag
   - Wrapped private checkboxes in conditionals
   - Only scan private folders when flag enabled

3. **`Supervertaler_v3.1.0-beta_CAT.py`**
   - Added ENABLE_PRIVATE_FEATURES flag
   - Modified SystemPromptsManager to skip private folders when disabled
   - Wrapped private checkbox in conditional

4. **`.supervertaler.local`** (NEW)
   - Created for your developer environment
   - Enables private features automatically

## Benefits

âœ… **Simple for users** - No confusing private options
âœ… **Powerful for you** - Full private folder support
âœ… **No code duplication** - Single codebase, one flag
âœ… **Git-friendly** - One repo, private features don't leak
âœ… **Zero maintenance** - Set it and forget it

## Setup on New Machine

To enable private features on a new development machine:

```bash
# Navigate to repo
cd C:\Dev\Supervertaler

# Create the local config file (one line!)
echo # Developer mode enabled > .supervertaler.local

# Done! Private features now enabled
```

## Testing

### Test User Mode (No Private Features)
1. Rename `.supervertaler.local` to `.supervertaler.local.bak`
2. Run either program
3. Verify no private checkboxes appear
4. Rename back to re-enable

### Test Developer Mode (Private Features Enabled)
1. Keep `.supervertaler.local` file
2. Run either program
3. Should see `[DEV MODE] Private features enabled` in console
4. Private checkboxes should appear with ðŸ”’ icon

## Migration Note

Your existing private prompts and projects are safe! They remain in their folders and will work immediately when you have `.supervertaler.local` present.

No data migration needed.
