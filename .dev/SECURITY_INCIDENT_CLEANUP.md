# SECURITY INCIDENT - Cleanup Log

## Incident Date: October 19, 2025

**Issue**: `user data_private/` folder was accidentally pushed to public GitHub repository.

**Contents that were exposed** (now being removed):
- Strategic discussion and business plans (STRATEGIC_DISCUSSION_ARCHIVE.md)
- Private prompts and custom instructions
- Private projects with test documents
- Private translation resources
- Personal/confidential DOCX files
- PDF test files with personal information

## Actions Taken

### ✅ Step 1: Remove from Git Index
- Ran `git rm -r --cached "user data_private/"`
- Committed removal: `89da7bb`

### ✅ Step 2: Remove from Git History
- Executed `git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch 'user data_private'" -- --all`
- Cleaned up with `git reflog expire --expire=now --all`
- Ran aggressive garbage collection: `git gc --prune=now --aggressive`

### ✅ Step 3: Update .gitignore
- Added `user data_private/` to `.gitignore` with security note
- Committed: `4786f1f`

### ⏳ Step 4: Force Push to GitHub (PENDING)
- **Requirement**: Temporarily disable branch protection rules on GitHub
- **Command ready**: `git push --force --all`
- **Reason**: Need to overwrite public history to remove private data

## Status

**Local Repository**: ✅ All private data removed from history
**GitHub Public Repo**: ⏳ **PENDING** - Needs manual intervention

### How to Complete

1. Visit: https://github.com/michaelbeijer/Supervertaler/settings/branches
2. Disable branch protection (or allow force pushes) for `main` branch
3. Run: `git push --force --all` (command ready in terminal)
4. Re-enable branch protection on GitHub
5. Verify no `user data_private/` in: https://github.com/michaelbeijer/Supervertaler

## Verification Commands

After force push completes, verify:
```bash
# Check current branch has no private folder
git ls-tree -r HEAD | grep "user data_private"  # Should return nothing

# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Verify .gitignore updated
git show HEAD:.gitignore | grep "user data_private"
```

## Prevention

- ✅ `user data_private/` added to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Local folder still exists in working directory (for your reference)
- ✅ Folder is protected in all future commits
- ✅ Structure preserved locally, safe from Git tracking

## Notes

- Git history has been completely rewritten (filter-branch)
- All 328 commits were processed
- Garbage collection cleaned up temporary references
- Repository is now ready for force push to GitHub
