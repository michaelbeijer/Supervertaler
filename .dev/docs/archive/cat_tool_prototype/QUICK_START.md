## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No segments appear after import"
- Make sure the DOCX has actual text content
- Check if the file opens correctly in Word
- Try a simpler document first

### "Export fails - Original DOCX not found"
- The prototype needs the original file for export
- Don't move or delete the source DOCX
- Keep it in the same location

### "Segmentation looks wrong"
- Current version uses simple regex
- Some sentences might merge or split incorrectly
- SRX rules will improve this in future versions

### "Application crashes"
- Make sure python-docx is installed: `pip install python-docx`
- Check for error messages in the log
- Try restarting the application

---

## 🌟 Pro Tips

### Speed Up Translation
- Use **Ctrl+D** for identical source/target segments
- Use **Ctrl+Enter** to quickly move through segments
- Use **Find/Replace** for repeated terms

### Quality Control
1. Translate everything first (mark as "Draft")
2. Review and mark as "Translated"
3. Final review → mark as "Approved"
4. Export when all approved

### Terminology Consistency
1. After first occurrence, press **Ctrl+F**
2. Find the source term
3. See all occurrences
4. Check translations are consistent
