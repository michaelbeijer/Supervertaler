# Fix: Truncated Glossary in Generated Prompts

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Custom Instructions showing incomplete glossary table (cut off mid-table)

---

## Problem

The analysis correctly generated a complete glossary with 33 technical terms:
```
| English term          | Dutch equivalent      | Notes / context     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Joint plate           | Voegplaat            | Used for joining... |
| Road sections         | Wegdelen             | Segments of road... |
... (33 terms total)
```

But the generated Custom Instructions showed:
```
**KEY TERMINOLOGY**

| English term          | Dutch equivalent      | Notes / context     |
|
```

**Cut off after just the header row!**

---

## Root Cause

**Token Limit Too Small**: `max_tokens=1500` was insufficient for complete response

**Why**:
- System Prompt: ~800-1000 tokens
- Custom Instructions text: ~500-700 tokens  
- Glossary table (33 terms): ~1200-1500 tokens
- **Total needed**: ~2500-3200 tokens
- **Limit set**: 1500 tokens ❌

**Result**: Response was truncated mid-glossary table

---

## Fix

Increased `max_tokens` from **1500** to **4000** for all LLM providers:

### OpenAI (GPT-4)
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=self.current_llm_model,
    messages=[...],
    temperature=0.4,
    max_tokens=4000  # Was 1500
)
```

### Anthropic (Claude)
```python
response = client.messages.create(
    model=self.current_llm_model,
    max_tokens=4000,  # Was 1500
    temperature=0.4,
    system=system_prompt,
    messages=[...]
)
```

### Google (Gemini)
```python
response = model.generate_content(
    combined,
    generation_config=genai.types.GenerationConfig(
        temperature=0.4,
        max_output_tokens=4000  # Was 1500
    )
)
```

### Added Truncation Detection

```python
# Check if response might be truncated
if len(answer) > 3500 and not answer.rstrip().endswith(('---', '.')):
    self.add_assistant_chat_message('warning', 
        "⚠️ Response may be truncated - if glossary is incomplete, try re-generating.")
```

**Benefits**:
- Warns user if response seems cut off
- Allows them to re-generate before applying
- Prevents incomplete glossaries from being saved

## Token Budget Analysis

### Typical Response Structure

```
---SYSTEM PROMPT---
[Global translation strategy]
- Translation direction: {source_lang} → {target_lang}
- Domain: Civil Engineering
- Tone: Formal, technical
- Key principles: precision, consistency
- Strategies: maintain structure, use glossary
[~800-1000 tokens]

---CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS---
[Project-specific guidance - 2-3 paragraphs]
Focus on this specific patent document...
Pay attention to: [challenges]
Ensure: [requirements]
[~500-700 tokens]

**KEY TERMINOLOGY**

| English term (20 chars) | Dutch term (20 chars) | Notes (40 chars) |
|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| [33 rows × ~45 tokens each = ~1500 tokens]

[Additional examples and notes: ~200-300 tokens]

---

TOTAL: ~2500-3200 tokens
```

### Why 4000 is Safe

- **Small documents** (15 terms): ~2000 tokens total
- **Medium documents** (25 terms): ~2800 tokens total
- **Large documents** (40 terms): ~3500 tokens total
- **Buffer**: 500 tokens for formatting variations

**4000 tokens** = Safe for all document sizes + margin

## Cost Impact

Increasing from 1500 to 4000 tokens:

**OpenAI GPT-4**:
- Input: ~2000 tokens (analysis) = ~$0.06
- Output: 4000 tokens (was 1500) = **+$0.30** (was $0.09)
- **Total**: ~$0.36 per generation (was $0.15)
- **Increase**: +$0.21 per generation

**Claude 3.5 Sonnet**:
- Input: ~2000 tokens = ~$0.006
- Output: 4000 tokens (was 1500) = **+$0.060** (was $0.0225)
- **Total**: ~$0.066 per generation (was $0.029)
- **Increase**: +$0.037 per generation

**Gemini 2.5 Pro**:
- Input: ~2000 tokens = ~$0.0025
- Output: 4000 tokens (was 1500) = **+$0.0050** (was $0.00188)
- **Total**: ~$0.0075 per generation (was $0.00438)
- **Increase**: +$0.00312 per generation

**Cost per document** (one-time generation):
- GPT-4: $0.36 (premium quality)
- Claude: $0.07 (balanced)
- Gemini: $0.01 (budget-friendly) ✅ **Best value**

**Worth it?** Absolutely! You only generate prompts once per document type, and getting a complete glossary is essential.

## Testing

**Please restart Supervertaler and test**:

1. **Analyze document** (PVET patent)
   - Should show complete glossary (33 terms) ✅ (Already working!)

2. **Generate Prompts** (the fix is here)
   - Should now show COMPLETE glossary in Custom Instructions
   - All 33 terms should be present
   - No cut-off mid-table

3. **Check for warning**
   - If you still see truncation warning
   - → Response was > 4000 tokens (very rare)
   - → Try regenerating or use fewer terms

4. **Apply to Project**
   - Custom Instructions should contain full glossary
   - Save to project
   - Ready for translation!
