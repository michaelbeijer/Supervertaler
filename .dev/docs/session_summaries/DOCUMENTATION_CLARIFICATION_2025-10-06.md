# Documentation Clarification Update - October 6, 2025

## Problem Identified

After repository cleanup, documentation didn't clearly distinguish between:
- **v2.4.0 (stable - production ready)** - Complete and tested
- **v2.5.0 (experimental - CAT editor development)** - Under active development

This could confuse users about which version to use and which documentation applies.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Updated README.md

**Added clear version section** at the top:
```markdown
## üì¶ Available Versions

### v2.4.0 (Stable - Production Ready) ‚úÖ
- Fully tested and stable
- Complete documentation available
- Ready for professional translation work

### v2.5.0 (Experimental - CAT Editor Development) üöß
- Under active development
- Features may change without notice
- Testing new CAT editor integration
- Full user guide pending

üí° Recommendation: Use v2.4.0 for production work
```

**Updated Documentation section** to clearly separate:
- v2.4.0: Points to complete User Guide
- v2.5.0: Points to feature-specific guides with note that full guide is pending

**Updated Features section** to show:
- v2.4.0 Feature Matrix
- v2.5.0 Experimental Features (with status indicators)

### 2. ‚úÖ Updated User Guide (v2.4.0)

**Added prominent warning at top**:
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This guide is for Supervertaler v2.4.0 (stable - production ready).py only.

If you're using v2.5.0 (experimental - CAT editor development).py, note that 
it's under active development and documentation is in progress.
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Created VERSION_GUIDE.md

Comprehensive guide explaining:
- Which documentation to use for which version
- Status of each documentation set
- Quick reference table
- Guidance for new users
- Guidance for developers

### 4. ‚úÖ Updated docs/README.md

Added prominent notice linking to VERSION_GUIDE.md for navigation help.

## Key Messages Established
