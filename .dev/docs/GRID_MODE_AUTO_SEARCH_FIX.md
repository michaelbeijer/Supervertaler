# Grid Mode Auto-Search Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-10  
**Issue**: Auto-search not triggering in Grid layout mode  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Problem

User reported that auto-search was not triggering when selecting segments. After adding debug logging, we discovered the issue:

**In List/Document mode**: `on_segment_select()` → Calls `schedule_auto_tm_search()` ✓  
**In Grid mode**: `select_grid_row()` → Does NOT call `schedule_auto_tm_search()` ❌

The auto-search was only implemented for List/Document mode, not for Grid mode!

## Root Cause

Supervertaler has **two different segment selection code paths**:

### List/Document Mode
```python
def on_segment_select(self, event):
    """Handle segment selection in grid (TreeView)"""
    # ... select segment ...
    self.load_segment_to_editor(self.current_segment)
    self.schedule_auto_tm_search()  # ✓ WAS PRESENT
```

### Grid Mode (memoQ-style)
```python
def select_grid_row(self, row_index):
    """Select a row in the custom grid"""
    # ... select row ...
    self.load_segment_to_grid_editor(self.current_segment)
    # ❌ MISSING: self.schedule_auto_tm_search()
```

Since Grid mode is the **default mode** and what the user was using, auto-search never triggered!

## Solution

Added `schedule_auto_tm_search()` call to `select_grid_row()`:

**File**: `Supervertaler_v3.0.0-beta_CAT.py`  
**Line**: ~5525

**Before:**
```python
# Load segment into editor panel
self.load_segment_to_grid_editor(self.current_segment)

def should_highlight_segment(self, segment):
```

**After:**
```python
# Load segment into editor panel
self.load_segment_to_grid_editor(self.current_segment)

# Trigger automatic TM search after delay
self.schedule_auto_tm_search()

def should_highlight_segment(self, segment):
```

## Debug Logging Added

Also added comprehensive debug logging to track the auto-search flow:

### in `on_segment_select()` (List/Document mode):
```python
self.log("📍 on_segment_select() called")
self.log(f"✓ Segment #{self.current_segment.id} selected")
self.log("🎯 About to call schedule_auto_tm_search()")
self.log("✓ schedule_auto_tm_search() called")
```

### in `schedule_auto_tm_search()`:
```python
self.log("⏱ Auto-search scheduled (2 seconds)...")
```

### in `auto_search_tm()`:
```python
self.log("🔍 Auto-search executing...")
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### In ANY Layout Mode (Grid, List, or Document):

**1. Select a segment:**
```
[time] ⏱ Auto-search scheduled (2 seconds)...
```

**2. Wait 2 seconds without navigating:**
```
[time] 🔍 Auto-search executing...
[time] ✓ Found N TM matches
```

**3. TM matches appear automatically in TM panel**

**4. Navigate quickly to another segment:**
```
[time] ⏱ Auto-search scheduled (2 seconds)...
[time] ⏱ Auto-search scheduled (2 seconds)...  ← Timer reset!
... wait 2 seconds ...
[time] 🔍 Auto-search executing...
```

## Layout Mode Differences

| Mode | Selection Handler | Auto-Search |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Grid** (default) | `select_grid_row()` | ✅ NOW FIXED |
| **List** | `on_segment_select()` | ✅ Already working |
| **Document** | `on_segment_select()` | ✅ Already working |

## Testing

**Test in Grid Mode** (default):
1. Restart Supervertaler (close completely)
2. Import document
3. Click on a segment in the grid
4. Wait 2 seconds
5. → Should see auto-search messages in log
6. → TM matches should appear in TM panel

**Test in List Mode**:
1. Switch to List mode (View menu)
2. Click on a segment
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. → Same auto-search behavior

**Test in Document Mode**:
1. Switch to Document mode
2. Navigate with Next button
3. Wait 2 seconds on each segment
4. → Same auto-search behavior

## Files Modified

- `Supervertaler_v3.0.0-beta_CAT.py`
  - Line ~5525: `select_grid_row()` - Added `schedule_auto_tm_search()` call
  - Line ~7650: `on_segment_select()` - Added debug logging
  - Line ~3700: `schedule_auto_tm_search()` - Added debug logging
  - Line ~3710: `auto_search_tm()` - Added debug logging

## User Impact

### Before Fix:
❌ Auto-search NEVER worked in Grid mode (default)  
✓ Auto-search worked in List/Document modes (rarely used)  
❌ Users had to manually click "🔍 Search" every time  

### After Fix:
✅ Auto-search works in ALL layout modes  
✅ 2-second delay prevents searches while navigating  
✅ Professional CAT tool behavior across all modes  
✅ Debug logging helps diagnose any future issues  

## Why This Was Missed

1. **Multiple code paths**: Grid mode has completely separate UI code
2. **Grid is default**: Most testing probably done in Grid mode, but feature added in List mode
3. **No error**: Code ran fine, just missing the call
4. **Silent failure**: No exception, just no auto-search

## Prevention

**For future features that affect segment selection:**
- ✅ Test in ALL three layout modes
- ✅ Check BOTH selection handlers:
  - `on_segment_select()` (List/Document)
  - `select_grid_row()` (Grid)
- ✅ Add logging to verify execution
- ✅ Document which modes are supported

## Related Features

This completes the auto-search feature across all modes:

- ✅ Works in List mode (TreeView)
- ✅ Works in Document mode (word processor)
- ✅ 2-second delay timer
- ✅ Timer resets on navigation
- ✅ Silent search (auto_triggered flag)
- ✅ Searches all enabled TMs
- ✅ Shows TM source in results
- ✅ Project TM auto-populated
- ✅ Debug logging enabled

All auto-search functionality is now complete! 🎉
