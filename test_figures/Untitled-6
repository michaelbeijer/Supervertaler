so, we get rid of:


Export > Supervertaler bilingual data (TXT)

and add:

Export > Manual copy/paste translation workflow (TXT)


then, if the user wants to use the Manual copy/paste translation workflow (TXT),

they import a TXT via 

Import > Manual copy/paste translation workflow (TXT)

and export via:

Export > Manual copy/paste translation workflow (TXT)

Note 1: 
these were previously called: "Manual copy/paste workflow (TXT)" and now "Manual copy/paste translation workflow (TXT)"

Note 2:
if they give Supervertaler a monolingual "Supervertaler bilingual data (TXT)", Sv take just the one column
if they give Supervertaler a bilingual "Supervertaler bilingual data (TXT)", Sv take just the 1st column (and ignores the second)



- Translated document (DOCX)
- Bilingual table (DOCX)
- TMX
- TSV
- memoQ DOCX
- CafeTran DOCX
- Trados Studio DOCX

maybe clearer:

- Translated document (DOCX/TXT)
- Supervertaler bilingual data (TXT)(Note that eventually we would want to be able to reimport this format;  users could  import a regular document intent Supervertaler ,  translate it,  and export one of these to give to a proofreader for example,  after which they would then reimport it back into their Supervertaler project,  like an irregular cat tool)
- Translation memory (TMX)
- xxx (TXT) (I think we should probably standardize on TXT; also explain what this is! - is it from the manual copy/paste workflow (see: "xxx") 
- memoQ bilingual table - Translated/Proofread (DOCX)
- CafeTran bilingual table - Translated/Proofread (DOCX)
- Trados bilingual table - Translated/Proofread (DOCX)

Bilingual data for reimport (TXT)
