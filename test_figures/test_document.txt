Technical Translation Test Document
====================================

Introduction
------------
This document demonstrates the figure context feature in Supervertaler v3.4.0-beta.

Section 1: Basic Figure Reference
----------------------------------
As shown in Figure 1, the system architecture consists of multiple components working together. The blue rectangular design in Figure 1 illustrates the primary data flow.

Section 2: Complex Figure Reference
------------------------------------
The circular pattern depicted in Figure 2A represents the iterative process. Note that Figure 2A uses a yellow and red color scheme to highlight critical pathways.

Section 3: Alternative Notation
--------------------------------
Technical specifications can be found in fig. 3b. The triangular structure shown in fig3b demonstrates the hierarchical relationship between modules.

Conclusion
----------
Refer to Figure 1, Figure 2A, and fig3b for complete visual documentation of the system design.
