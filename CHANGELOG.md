## [1.6.6] - November 23, 2025

### ✅ Simplified TM/Termbase Management System

**Major Redesign:**

- 🎯 **Simple Read/Write Checkbox System**
  - Removed confusing "Active" checkbox and "Project TM/Termbase" concepts
  - **Translation Memories:** Simple Read (green ✓) and Write (blue ✓) checkboxes
  - **Termbases:** Simple Read (green ✓) and Write (blue ✓) checkboxes  
  - All TMs and termbases start completely unchecked by default
  - Users explicitly check Read to use for matching, Write to allow updates
  
- 📊 **Auto-Priority System for Termbases**
  - Priorities 1-N automatically assigned to Read-enabled termbases
  - Priority #1 = Project Termbase (pink highlighting, highest priority)
  - Priority #2, #3, etc. = Background termbases (lower priorities)
  - No manual project termbase designation needed - just check Read boxes
  - Priority based on activation order (ranking in database)

- 🎨 **Cleaner Column Layout**
  - **TMs:** `TM Name | Languages | Entries | Read | Write | Last Modified | Description`
  - **Termbases:** `Type | Name | Languages | Terms | Read | Write | Priority`
  - Removed redundant columns and confusing labels
  - Type auto-shows "📌 Project" for priority #1, "Background" for others

- 🔒 **Read-Only Database Defaults**
  - New TMs created with `read_only=1` (Write unchecked by default)
  - New termbases created with `read_only=1` (Write unchecked by default)
  - Prevents accidental updates to reference memories
  - User must explicitly enable Write for TMs/termbases they want to update

**Benefits:**
- Much simpler mental model: Read = use for matching, Write = allow updates
- No more confusion about "Active" vs "Project" vs "Background"
- Project termbase is simply the highest priority (first activated)
- Clear visual feedback with color-coded checkboxes (green Read, blue Write)
- Safer defaults prevent accidental corruption of reference resources

- ✨ **Find/Replace Highlighting System** - Complete rewrite using consistent QTextCursor approach
  - "Find Next" now correctly highlights matches with yellow background
  - "Highlight All" button now actually highlights all matches in the grid
  - Font size no longer changes during navigation (previously shrunk with each find)
  - Switched from QLabel+HTML (which replaced widgets) to QTextCursor+QTextCharFormat (preserves existing widgets)
  - Matches same highlighting system used by filter boxes
  - Supports case-sensitive/insensitive, whole words, and entire segment modes

- ✨ **No More TM Saves During Find/Replace** - Eliminated slowdowns during search navigation
  - Added `find_replace_active` flag to disable background TM saves
  - Prevents segments from being saved to TM on every "Find Next" click
  - Re-enables TM saves when dialog closes
  - Also disables expensive TM/MT/LLM lookups during find/replace operations
  - Results in much faster navigation through search results

**Added:**

- 🌍 **Bidirectional TM Search** - TMs now search in both directions automatically
  - When translating nl→en, also searches en→nl TMs for reverse matches
  - Example: English source text can match Dutch source in reverse TM
  - Reverse matches clearly marked with "Reverse" indicator
  - Improves TM utilization by ~2x without any user action required

- 🌍 **Language Variant Matching** - Base language codes match all regional variants
  - "en" matches "en-US", "en-GB", "en-AU" automatically
  - "nl" matches "nl-NL", "nl-BE" automatically  
  - TMX import now handles language variants gracefully
  - User can choose to strip variants or preserve them during import
  - Supports bidirectional matching with variants (e.g., nl-BE → en-US works both ways)

- 💾 **Activated TM Persistence** - Projects remember which TMs are active
  - Activated TMs saved to `project.json` in `tm_settings.activated_tm_ids`
  - Automatically restored when project is reopened
  - No more manually re-activating TMs for each project session
  - Works per-project (different projects can have different active TMs)

- 📝 **TM Pre-Check in Batch Translation** - Saves API costs by checking TM first
  - Before making expensive API calls, checks if 100% TM matches exist
  - Auto-inserts TM matches and skips API translation for those segments
  - Shows clear log of how many API calls were saved
  - Can save significant costs on projects with high TM leverage
  - Controlled by "Check TM before API call" setting (enabled by default)

- 🎨 **Language Display Normalization** - Consistent language variant format
  - All language variants displayed as lowercase-UPPERCASE (e.g., nl-NL, en-US)
  - Previously: inconsistent formats like "nl-nl", "EN-us", "NL-BE"

  - Added `get_base_lang_code()` to extract base from variants (en-US → en)
  - Added `normalize_lang_variant()` for consistent display formatting
  - Added `languages_are_compatible()` for base code comparison
  - Database queries use LIKE pattern: `(source_lang = 'en' OR source_lang LIKE 'en-%')`
  - Files: `modules/tmx_generator.py` lines 119-156, `modules/database_manager.py` lines 652-676

- **TMX Import with Variants:**
  - `detect_tmx_languages()` reads all language codes from TMX
  - `check_language_compatibility()` analyzes variant mismatches
  - `_load_tmx_into_db()` accepts `strip_variants` parameter
  - User dialog offers "Import with variant stripping" vs "Create new TM"
  - Files: `modules/translation_memory.py` lines 408-557, `Supervertaler.py` lines 4807-4903

## [1.7.8] - November 22, 2025

### 🔍 Filter Highlighting Fix

**Fixed:**

- ✨ **Filter Search Term Highlighting** - Fixed highlighting of search terms in filtered segments
  - Source and target filter boxes now correctly highlight matching terms in yellow
  - Previously used delegate-based highlighting which was bypassed by cell widgets
  - New implementation uses widget-internal highlighting with QTextCursor + QTextCharFormat
  - Case-insensitive matching: "test", "TEST", "TeSt" all match "test"
  - Multiple matches per cell are highlighted correctly
  - Highlights automatically clear when filters are removed

**Technical Details:**

- **Root Cause:** Source/target cells use `setCellWidget()` with QTextEdit widgets, which completely bypass `QStyledItemDelegate.paint()` method
- **Solution:** Created `_highlight_text_in_widget()` method that applies highlighting directly within QTextEdit widgets
- **Implementation:**
  - Uses `QTextCursor` to find all occurrences of search term in widget's document
  - Applies `QTextCharFormat` with yellow background (#FFFF00) to each match
  - Clears previous highlights before applying new ones
  - Modified `apply_filters()` to call widget highlighting instead of delegate approach
  - `clear_filters()` automatically clears highlights by reloading grid
- **Files Modified:**
  - `Supervertaler.py` (lines ~15765-15810): New `_highlight_text_in_widget()` method
  - `Supervertaler.py` (lines ~15779-15860): Modified `apply_filters()` to use widget highlighting
- **Documentation Added:**
  - `docs/FILTER_HIGHLIGHTING_FIX.md` - Complete technical explanation of the fix

**User Experience:**

- Filter boxes now work as expected with visible yellow highlighting
- Improves searchability and visual feedback when filtering segments
- No performance impact with large segment counts (tested with 219 segments)

## [1.7.7] - November 21, 2025

### 🎯 Termbase Display Customization

**Added:**

- ✨ **User-Configurable Termbase Sorting** - Control how termbase matches are displayed
  - Three sorting options available in Settings → General:
    - **Order of appearance in source text** (default) - Matches appear as they occur in the segment
    - **Alphabetical (A-Z)** - Matches sorted by source term alphabetically
    - **By length (longest first)** - Longer multi-word terms prioritized over shorter ones
  - Sorting preference persists across sessions
  - Only affects termbase matches; TM, MT, and LLM results maintain their existing order

- ✨ **Smart Substring Filtering** - Reduces termbase match clutter
  - Optional "Hide shorter termbase matches" checkbox in Settings → General
  - Automatically filters out shorter terms that are fully contained within longer matched terms
  - Example: If both "cooling" and "cooling system" match, only "cooling system" is shown
  - Helps focus on the most relevant multi-word terminology
  - Can be toggled on/off without restarting the application

**Enhanced:**

- 🔧 **Bold Font for Project Resources** - Project termbases and TMs now display with bold provider codes (TB, TM) instead of asterisks for cleaner visual distinction
- 🎨 **Translation Results Panel** - Added parent app reference for accessing user settings dynamically

**Technical Details:**

- Settings stored in `ui_preferences.json` under `general_settings`
- `TranslationResultsPanel` now accepts `parent_app` parameter for settings access
- New methods: `_sort_termbase_matches()` and `_filter_shorter_matches()` in `translation_results_panel.py`
- Sorting uses case-insensitive comparison for alphabetical mode
- Filtering uses substring detection with length comparison
- Files Modified:
  - `Supervertaler.py` (lines 2391-2393, 7377-7406, 8316-8360, 8930, 9548, 12604-12606)
  - `modules/translation_results_panel.py` (lines 626-628, 1201-1276, 1324-1329)

**User Experience:**

- Settings are immediately accessible via Settings → General → TM/Termbase Options
- Tooltips explain each option clearly
- Changes apply to all subsequent segment matches
- No performance impact on match retrieval

---

## [1.7.6] - November 20, 2025

### 💾 Auto Backup System

**Added:**

- ✨ **Automatic Backup System** - Prevents data loss during translation work
  - Auto-saves project.json at configurable intervals (1-60 minutes, default: 5 minutes)
  - Auto-exports TMX backup file in same folder as project.json
  - TMX backup includes all segments for maximum recovery capability
  - Settings UI in Settings → General tab with enable/disable toggle
  - Non-intrusive background operation with timestamp logging
  - Settings persist across sessions in ui_preferences.json

## [1.7.5] - November 20, 2025

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - Translation Memory Save Flood

**Fixed:**

- ✅ **TM Save Flood During Grid Operations** - CRITICAL FIX
  - **Issue:** Every time `load_segments_to_grid()` was called (startup, filtering, clear filters), all segments with status "translated"/"confirmed"/"approved" would trigger false TM database saves 1-2 seconds after grid load
  - **Symptoms:**
    - 10+ second UI freeze on projects with 200+ segments
    - Massive unnecessary database writes (219 saves on a 219-segment project)
    - Made filtering operations completely unusable
    - Could potentially corrupt data or cause performance issues on large projects
  - **Root Cause:** Qt internally queues document change events when `setPlainText()` is called on QTextEdit widgets, even when signals are blocked. When `blockSignals(False)` was called after grid loading, Qt delivered all these queued events, triggering `textChanged` for every segment. By that time, the suppression flag had already been restored, so the suppression check failed.
  - **Solution:**
    - Added `_initial_load_complete` flag to `EditableGridTextEditor` class
    - Signal handler now ignores the first spurious `textChanged` event after widget creation
    - All subsequent real user edits are processed normally
    - Clean, minimal fix that doesn't interfere with Qt's event system
  - **Testing:** Verified on BRANTS project (219 segments) - zero false TM saves during startup, filtering, and filter clearing
  - **Files Modified:** Supervertaler.py (lines 835, 11647-11651)

**Impact:**
- **Performance:** Grid loading is now instant with no post-load freeze
- **Database:** Eliminates 200+ unnecessary database writes per grid operation
- **User Experience:** Filtering and grid operations are now fast and responsive
- **Data Integrity:** Prevents potential database corruption from excessive writes

  - Works with Unified Prompt Library system
  
- ✅ **Image Context Folder Persistence** - Projects remember loaded image folders
  - Image context folder path saved to project.json
  - Automatically reloads all images from saved folder on project open
  - Updates UI status label showing image count and folder name
  - Logs success/warnings if folder path has changed
  
- ✅ **Attached Prompts Persistence** - All attached prompts are restored
  - Maintains complete prompt configuration across sessions
  - Updates attached prompts list UI on restore

**Technical:**
- Changed from `library.set_primary_prompt()` to `_set_primary_prompt()` for UI updates
- Changed from `library.attach_prompt()` to `_attach_prompt()` for UI updates
- Added `image_context_folder` to `prompt_settings` in project.json
- Proper UI synchronization on project load for all prompt settings

**User Experience:**
Now when you save a project, it remembers:
- ✓ Which primary prompt you selected
- ✓ Which prompts you attached
- ✓ Which image folder you loaded
- ✓ All settings restore automatically on project open

- ✅ **Termbase Selection** - Terms now save only to selected termbases (previously saved to all active termbases)
  - Filter logic working correctly with INTEGER termbase IDs
  - Debug logging confirmed type matching works as expected
- ✅ **Segment Highlighting Consistency** - Termbase highlighting now works consistently across all segments
  - Fixed cache iteration to handle new dict structure with `term_id` keys
  - Updated all code paths that consume termbase matches

**Technical Changes:**
- **Dictionary Structure Change:**
  - Changed from: `matches[source_term] = {...}` (only one translation per source)
  - Changed to: `matches[term_id] = {'source': source_term, 'translation': target_term, ...}` (multiple translations allowed)
- **Code Locations Updated:**
  - `find_termbase_matches_in_source()` - Changed dict key from source_term to term_id
  - `highlight_termbase_matches()` - Updated to extract source term from match_info
  - `DocumentView._create_highlighted_html()` - Updated iteration logic
  - `_get_cached_matches()` - Fixed to extract source term from dict values (2 locations)
