- **NEW: Advanced System Prompts GUI** - Added collapsible section allowing users to:
  - View and edit underlying system prompts for Translation and Proofreading modes
  - Use template variables like `{source_lang}` and `{target_lang}`
  - Preview final prompts with current language settings
  - Reset prompts to defaults with one click
  - Organize prompts in tabbed interface (Translation/Proofreading)
  - Click section header to expand/collapse for easy access
- **NEW: Custom Prompt Library** - Added comprehensive prompt management system:
  - Save custom system prompt sets to local files (`custom_prompts/` folder)

  - Delete unwanted prompt sets with confirmation
  - Automatic file organization with JSON format and timestamps
  - Seamless integration with existing Advanced System Prompts interface
- Includes fixes and improvements:
  - OutputGenerationAgent writes TXT and TMX (Translate mode).
  - Restored required agents/factories for GUI startup (TMAgent, BilingualFileIngestionAgent, Gemini/Claude agents, factory helpers).
  - Fixed TMX parsing deprecation by using explicit None checks (TMAgent.load_tm).
  - Rewrote GeminiProofreadingAgent to correctly call Gemini and parse numbered outputs + change summaries.
  - Corrected mislabeled logs in ClaudeProofreadingAgent.
  - Added TranslationApp.enable_buttons to re-enable UI after processing.
  - Improved multimodal image handling (Gemini: PIL.Image; Claude: base64).

## 2.1.0
- Initial 2.1.x baseline with tracked-changes context, multimodal figure support, and multi‚Äëprovider (Claude/Gemini/OpenAI) scaffolding.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-05
- Added Document Images Folder support to Claude and OpenAI providers (previously Gemini-only).
- Implemented base64 PNG image embedding helper for multimodal requests.
- Updated Claude and OpenAI agents (Translate/Proofread) to interleave text with images when figure refs are detected.
- Aligned Gemini proofreader image handling to pass PIL images consistently.
- Minor logs and prompts improvements to show when images are added to context.
- Bumped APP_VERSION to 2.1.0.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-09-04

### Added
- DOCX tracked changes ingestion (Word revisions) + TSV (Original<TAB>Final) ingestion
- Tracked Changes Browser (search, detail pane, context copy)
- Custom Instructions free‚Äëtext field appended to system/system‚Äëlike prompt
- Automatic TMX export for Translate mode (excludes error/empty targets)
- Central `APP_VERSION` constant and startup banner
- Dynamic Gemini model listing & manual refresh
- Inline figure/image normalization + multimodal context injection (when images folder supplied)
- Exact-match Translation Memory application (TMX / TXT) pre‚ÄëLLM
- Unified multi‚Äëprovider agent factories (Claude / Gemini / OpenAI)

### Changed
- Translate mode ingestion: always reads only first TAB column (prevents accidental reuse of prior target columns)
- Unified single ‚ÄúContext Sources‚Äù help block (modes + images + tracked changes + TM + instructions)
- Proofread mode comment synthesis: merges original comment + AI summary only if changes or meaningful summary
- Improved logging (queue-based), clearer warnings, degraded mode if Pillow or provider libs missing
- Tracked change relevance heuristic (exact + partial word overlap) for per‚Äëbatch injection

### Fixed
- Missing `APP_VERSION` (NameError) bug
- Duplicate / stale target propagation on re‚Äëtranslation of exported files
- Previous proofreader undefined-variable implementation replaced with stable parser
- Safe TM language normalization; improved missing image warnings
- Placeholder insertion when model omits numbered line output

## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-31

### Added
- PROOFREAD mode alongside TRANSLATE
- Multimodal prompt support (image-aware translations)
- Document Images Folder (fig reference resolution: Figure / Fig. / Figuur patterns)
- Support for .png .jpg .jpeg .webp image formats
- Figure reference detection & normalization (e.g., ‚ÄúFig. 1A‚Äù ‚Üí fig1a)

### Changed
- Major translation engine refactor & chunk orchestration
- Enhanced multimodal chunk batching
- Expanded structured logging & exception handling

### Breaking Changes
- Reworked provider abstraction layer
- Configuration expectations updated (api_keys.txt + central factories)

## [1.5.0] - 2025-07-02

### Added
- Enhanced GUI
- Improved error reporting & logging depth
- More resilient file handling / normalization

### Changed
- Performance optimizations for large documents
- Broader model compatibility

### Fixed
- Stability issues under long multi-batch runs
- Memory usage reductions in large-file scenarios

## [1.0.0] - 2025-05-20

### Added
- Initial public release
- Basic AI translation (single provider)
- Text-only ingestion & chunking
- Early Translation Memory integration
- Core GUI
