CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
Preserve ALL formatting elements exactly as they appear in the source:
- Line breaks and paragraph boundaries
- Bullet points and numbering
- Indentation and spacing
- Special characters and punctuation marks
- Headers and subheaders
- Tables and lists structure

Do NOT:
- Add or remove line breaks
- Change list formatting or numbering
- Alter spacing or indentation
- Modify structural elements

Translate only the text content while keeping ALL formatting identical to the source:
