# System Prompts (Layer 2: Domain Prompts)

Domain prompts give the AI specialized expertise for different industries, fields, and translation contexts. This is the foundational layer that defines what domain knowledge the AI should apply.

## What Goes Here

Domain prompts provide specialized knowledge for:

- **Medical/Healthcare**: Pharmaceutical docs, medical devices, clinical trials
- **Legal**: Contracts, patents, court documents, legislation
- **Technical**: User manuals, specifications, engineering docs
- **Marketing**: Advertising, creative content, brand messaging
- **Financial**: Annual reports, financial statements, investment documents
- **Gaming**: Video games, entertainment, interactive media
- **And more...**: Any specialized domain requiring expert knowledge

## How Domain Prompts Work

Domain prompts define the AI's expertise and knowledge base:
- Medical terminology and conventions
- Legal language and document structure
- Technical accuracy and clarity
- Industry-specific best practices

## File Formats

Domain prompts can be saved as:
- **Markdown (.md)**: Recommended for readability and ease of editing
- **JSON (.json)**: For structured prompts with additional metadata

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate the domain or specialization:
- `Medical Translation Specialist (system prompt).md`
- `Legal Translation Specialist (system prompt).md`
- `Technical Documentation Expert (system prompt).md`

The "(system prompt)" suffix helps identify these as Layer 2 domain prompts.

## Creating Your Own

- Hybrid specializations (e.g., legal-medical, technical-marketing)
- Company-specific domains
- Regional specializations

Use the "Create New Domain Prompt" button in the Prompt Manager to get started with a template.

## Combining with Other Layers

Domain prompts work best when combined with other layers:

**Example workflow:**
1. **Layer 2 (Domain)**: Medical Translation Specialist
2. **Layer 3 (Project)**: Client ABC's pharmaceutical project
3. **Layer 4 (Style)**: German style guide

Result: Expert medical translation customized for the client using proper German formatting.

## Usage

Select a domain prompt in the Prompt Manager → Domain Prompts tab. The AI will adopt that expertise for all translations until you change or clear the selection.

## Tips

1. **Choose the Right Domain**: Select the domain that best matches your content
2. **One at a Time**: Use one domain prompt per project for clarity
3. **Customize as Needed**: Edit existing prompts to match your specific requirements
4. **Test and Refine**: Adjust prompts based on translation quality
5. **Save Variations**: Create specialized versions for different sub-domains
