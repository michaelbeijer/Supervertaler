# Style Guides (Layer 4)

Style guides define language-specific formatting, punctuation, and style conventions to ensure your translations meet regional expectations and professional standards.

## What Goes Here

Style guides typically include:

- **Number formatting**: thousand separators (1,000 vs 1.000), decimal points
- **Date and time formats**: MM/DD/YYYY vs DD-MM-YYYY
- **Unit conventions**: spaces before units, abbreviations
- **Currency formatting**: symbol placement, spacing
- **Punctuation rules**: quotation marks, commas, dashes
- **Tone and register**: formal vs informal, technical level
- **Cultural adaptations**: idioms, expressions

## File Format

Style guides can be saved as:
- **Markdown (.md)**: Recommended for readability
- **JSON (.json)**: For structured data with metadata

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate the target language or locale:
- `English (style guide).md`
- `German (style guide).md`
- `Spanish Latin America (style guide).md`
